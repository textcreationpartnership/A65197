            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>To be a nurſing <hi>Mother</hi> to the Church, is the dignity and duty of a QVEENE; to which attribute ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you have a right, as well by your vertue as your honour, I am emboldned to proſtrate my ſelfe, with this ſmall <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> at your Royall feet. It hath pleaſed God out of his infinite, and by mee, never-to-be-forgotten
<pb facs="tcp:105178:3"/> mercy, to call me to the Communion of the <hi>Catholique Church;</hi> for which I have alſo been called to account, and that in your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi> family; which hath moved me (with other conſiderations) as to publiſh this my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſo to crave your <hi>Majeſties</hi> Patronage both of it &amp; me. Never did perſecution againſt <hi>Catholiques</hi> in <hi>England</hi> rage as now it doth; where like <hi>Herod,</hi> who as ſoon as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was borne, ſent forth men to destroy him; So they, as ſoon as one is made a <hi>Catholique,</hi> or known to be ſo, ſeek his deſtruction. And as <hi>Herod</hi> becauſe he would be ſure (as he thought) to deſtroy <hi>Chriſt,</hi> deſtroyed all the <hi>Children</hi> that were about his age; So doe they purſue the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as having a little reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with <hi>Catholiques,</hi> that ſo they may (as they hope) ſpunge out all the remains and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>Catholique religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as God ſent our <hi>Saviour</hi> into the world, and ſubjected him to all humane infirmities (except ſinne) like unto us, that he might be mercifull; So hath he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> even to a lower deſcent of ſuffering (conſidering your exaltation, from whence it must take its meaſure) than any other, who like an invaluable <hi>Diamond,</hi> were made to be firmely ſet in the
<pb facs="tcp:105178:3"/> moſt precious esteem of mankind; but by the unrelenting malice of monsters have been brought to extreme degrees of calamity: whoſe excellence as it is endeared to us all by your ſufferings; ſo our ſufferings (your heart being the more intendred by the ſenſe of your own) we hope, ſhall render <hi>your Majeſty</hi> the more propitious to us; who ſuffer not only as good ſubjects to the <hi>King,</hi> but to God alſo in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique religion.</hi> Your gracious ſoule hath more antidote in it, then all the world hath poyſon; which will therefore in your affliction make you like the Sun, which ſhewes his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt countenance in his lowest declenſion; and bring you out of it, like gold out of the fire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, not conſumed; which when it doth, as the good theef did our <hi>Saviour on the Croſſe;</hi> So we beſeech you <hi>Madam,</hi> remember us when you come into your Kingdome. In the mean time, we will remember you in our praiers; That your fortune may ſurmount your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and your vertue your fortune; That your greatneſſe may be above envy, your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe above detraction; That your illustrious example may darken the ages paſt, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them to come; that you may live beloved and die lamented; lamented by earth, but joy'd by heaven; of which you ſhall be a part
<pb facs="tcp:105178:4"/> as well as a partaker, in giving the happineſſe of your preſence, and receive as a reward of all your fufferings a never fading Diadem of glory: So prayes,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Need not write much by way of <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to you, ſeeing the whole <hi>Book</hi> is but an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi> to the <hi>Reader;</hi> wherein I declare thoſe <hi>Motives</hi> which led me to the <hi>Catholique Roman Church,</hi> and which (I hope) will have the ſame influence upon many others. For I neither think my ſelfe ſo weake, as that I alone ſhould be ſeduced, if the <hi>Motives</hi> be inſufficient; nor ſo ſtrong, they being true, that I alone ſhould comprehend them, and conquer all oppoſition either of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or the will, which might barre obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto.</p>
            <p>All that I deſire is, that the <hi>Reader</hi> will addreſſe himſelfe to the reading of this <hi>Book,</hi> with the ſame diſpoſition of mind, that I did to the meditation and ſearch of the things contained therin, before I wrote it; And that is, to devest his mind of all prepoſſeſſed opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and worldly interests, in favour of any other <hi>Religion,</hi> and diſlike of this; That ſo his <hi>Soule</hi> may be now, as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay it is, when it comes into the world, like a <hi>ſmooth table</hi> or <hi>white paper,</hi> wherein there is nothing painted or
<pb facs="tcp:105178:6"/> written; And having read, understood, and conſidered, let him make his choice, and I doubt not but he will (by the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, which is never wanting to thoſe, that are not wanting to themſelves,) imprint in his Soule the characters of this <hi>eternall truth.</hi> But if he harbour contrary opinions with obſtinacy of will, and a beleefe of their impoſſibility of being erroneous, he cannot be a meet judge in this cauſe; Seeing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of Philoſophy, <hi>INTUS EXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STENS PROHIBET ALIENUM, That which is within, ſtops the entrance of that which is without;</hi> Even as hee that hath the chriſtalline humor of his eye tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cannot ſee any thing in its owne true colours; And ſuch a mans partiall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is like a judg that is already bribed on one ſide. So alſo if there ly hid in his heart any ſiniſter and inordinate affection, it will check the entrance of the true and ſaving faith, maugre all the moſt powerfull perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that can be uſed to introduce it; like as a peice of iron or other matter remaining in a wound, will controule the efficacy of any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy applyed thereunto. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith of the Jewes, <hi>How can ye beleeve, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that is of God only?</hi> John <hi>5.
<pb facs="tcp:105178:6"/> 44.</hi> And in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Supper</hi> (Luke <hi>14.24.</hi>) the Master of the feaſt profeſſeth that none of them that were invited ſhould taſt thereof, becauſe they coloured their deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls with the excuſes of farming, marrying, and the like. By which you may ſee, that the honours, pleaſures, and profits of the world, and their contraries, poverty, diſgrace and paine, are, the one ſort like <hi>Syrenes,</hi> which (melting our hearts in delight) arreſt us here, and divert us from proſecuting our christian courſe; and the other, (as the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Anak</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>) fright us from entring into the land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> Numb. <hi>12.33.</hi>

            <p>But if having truely depoſed all obstinate prepoſſeſſions of judgement and worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; and ſo having read this book, you are not yet thereby perſwaded that the <hi>Roman Catholique</hi> is the only true <hi>Religion,</hi> wherein ſalvation is to be had, and therefore at any perill to be imbraced, this muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from want of underſtanding in you, and capacity of the reaſons here alleadged; to which I can apply no cure, but my prayers, ſaying as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Timothy, Conſider what I ſay, and our Lord give thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in all things, 2.</hi> Tim. <hi>2.7.</hi> To which if you adde your owne frequent and zealous
<pb facs="tcp:105178:7"/> prayers alſo, I aſſure my ſelfe you ſhall find the ſame effect which the ſervant of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, that your eyes ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you ſhall ſee, that <hi>they that be with us, are more, then they that be with them; 4.</hi> Kings <hi>6.16.</hi> you ſhall underſtand that the reaſons on the <hi>Catholique</hi> ſide, are far more, and more powerfull, than the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all other Religions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And if after the reading of this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi> there remaine in any ones judgement, any objection againſt the ſufficiency of any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and motive here alleadged, or any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the <hi>Catholique Faith,</hi> which is not here taken away, or any defence of your own religion, whatſoever the religion or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of defence be, if you pleaſe to ſeek, you may find thoſe amongſt you, that can (much better than I) clear all your doubts, or if you have a mind, (being unlearned,) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive further information from me, or (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned) to oppoſe me, I oblige my ſelfe to anſwer both the one and the other, and that with due circumſtances and reſpects, aiming at nothing elſe, but the Glory of God, and the good of your ſouls. And to this end, I have in this later <hi>Edition</hi> added the diſcuſſion of two particular points of controverſie more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the reſt, though more breefly then they
<pb facs="tcp:105178:7"/> might be, being ſuch as I know moſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> doe much ſtumble at, to wit, <hi>of the lawfulneſſe of communion in one kind; And of prayer both publique and private in the Latine tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let any of you think (or ſhew that he thinkes ſo by his practiſe) that to purſue this queſt of the true <hi>Religion,</hi> and drive it home to its iſſue, is not worth his time; or not ſo much worth it, as the purſuit of pleaſure, profit or other worldly availes; ſeeing you all well know what our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith in the Goſpell, <hi>what doth it profit a man, if he ſhall gaine the whole world and loſe his owne ſoule.</hi> Math. <hi>16.26.</hi> Suffer not your ſelves through the ſeducing of others, or your owne obſtinacy, to be undone by your too much confidence, continuing ſtill in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, like that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. <hi>10.23.</hi> wherein no man roſe from his place; nor ſay with the <hi>Laodiceans, I am rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with goods, and have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. <hi>3.17.</hi> But according to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> direction, <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good, 1</hi> Theſ. <hi>5.21.</hi> And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journe not this tryall to a future time, ſeeing the preſent, is that only which is in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Say not as <hi>Felix</hi> ſaid to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> putting him off for the preſent, <hi>when I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb facs="tcp:105178:8"/> ſeaſon, I will call for thee;</hi> Acts <hi>24.25.</hi> For this is but a ſuggeſtion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to retard your returne unto God. The fooliſh virgins you know, while they delayed their preparations, and too late went to buy their oyle, the bridegroome paſſed by, and they were excluded: <hi>Mat. 25.</hi> therefore, <hi>to day if ye will heare his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> Pſal. <hi>94.8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, think upon the difference betwixt this life and the future; that this is but of the indurance of a few ſcore of years, and that therein, even to the happieſt, miſery is their freehold, their inheritance, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Man borne of a woman, living but a ſhort time, is filled with many miſeries, Job. 14.1.</hi> and that the next life is eternall, either in unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable felicity or torment, according as men do here ſeale up their lives: Which infinity of time, and extremity of good or evill, without any mixture of the contrary, are two ſuch circumſtances, that their conſideration ſhould make a man ſleight and contemne all things that concern him for this moment of time, in compariſon of thoſe things which concerne the ſetling of that future eſtate, which is never to receive an end or change; and he that doth not ſo, is ſurely worſe than prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> that neglected his birthright for a meſſe of pottage,
<pb facs="tcp:105178:8"/> or the wicked <hi>Jewes</hi> that preferred <hi>Barabbas</hi> before <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O who can comprehend eternity! Or know what it is to be damned for ever? Yet to reflect often thereon, me thinks ſhould make a man never to pauſe, or reſt in his mind, till he had put himſelfe into ſuch a condition as by which he might have just ground to hope to eſcape that miſerable and endleſſe end.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing in the opinion of all men, there are but two ſorts of things required in this matter, that is, <hi>things to be believed,</hi> and <hi>things to be done;</hi> and that the things to be done are conſequences of the former, it behoveth you in the firſt place to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the things you ought to believe; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mark 16.16.</hi> that <hi>He that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> Which words, in reaſon, cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of ſome one, or few, yea or many points of faith, excluding any one, but of all that our <hi>Saviour</hi> commanded to be believed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Commiſſion given to his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Goe ye therefore and teach all nations,</hi> or <hi>teaching them to keep all things whatſoever I have commanded you;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exhortation of <hi>S. Jude</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> in his time, <hi>That ye earneſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for the faith which was once delivered
<pb facs="tcp:105178:9"/> to the Saints,</hi> (Ep. Iude v. <hi>3.</hi>) Nor can you be probably aſſured that you have the faith once delivered to the <hi>Saints,</hi> the whole faith which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> taught all nations, but by examining (according to your abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) the pleas for it on both ſides; ſeeing it is granted by all, that the <hi>Roman Faith</hi> was the true and perfect faith, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelfe by conſequence confeſſeth, where he ſaith, <hi>I thank my God that your faith is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed throughout the whole world,</hi> Rom. <hi>1.8.</hi> And if the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> have not changed her faith, as in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then you that differ and ſeparate from her, muſt be accuſed of novelty and change, in forſaking her <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>communion,</hi> which formerly in your predeceſſors you held.

                  <p>The introduction; And that the knowledge of the meanes to arrive unto eternall life, is not otherwiſe attaineable, then by <hi>Faith</hi> grounded on the Word of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. SAINT <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> doth thus comfort, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and command us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14.15. <hi>But and if you ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake, happy are ye. But be not affraid of their fear, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be troubled.

               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. This happineſſe and comfort of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105178:10"/> ſuffering for a good cauſe is remarkably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by our Saviour in the fift of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> where the bleſſings of other vertues are placed in the future time, that they that mourne ſhall be comforted, they that are mercifull ſhall obtain mercy, and ſo of the reſt; but of the poore in ſpirit, and of the poore abſolutely, (as <hi>S. Luke</hi> hath it, ch. 6.20.) and of thoſe that ſuffer for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſake, it is affirmed in the preſent time, that <hi>theirs is the Kingdome of God, Mat.</hi> 5.10. the other Beatitudes are but in reverſion, but this in preſent poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. And this by the mercy of God I feele in my ſelfe; for heaven is more the joy then the place, and this joy, becauſe God thinks it not fit, as yet, to call me to it, he hath ſent to mee; ſo that I can ſay with S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I glory in tribulation.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> encouragement to abandon feare, and to ſanctifie the Lord, I will by his grace daily put in practice. But my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent undertaking is the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> command, to give an anſwer to every one that asketh me a reaſon of the hope (and faith from whence the hope ſprings) that is in mee; and this with the enjoyned circumſtances of meekneſſe towards men, and the feare of God.</p>

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105178:10"/>§. 4. And as ſome men here have asked me a reaſon; ſo if I were in <hi>England,</hi> I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelfe many more would do ſo; and having heard of my change do aske one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and that with as much wonder and ſorrow, as beliefe thereof. To theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to all other both <hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I give this enſuing anſwer for ſatisfaction. To <hi>Catholiques,</hi> that they may quit all feare of my recoyling; to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> that they may be invited to follow my example, which though it be founded in an unworthy perſon, yet in ſo glorious an action, as coming to the boſome of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> they have no reaſon to diſdaine to follow me.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. In this affaire it is much more eaſie to find an entrance then an end. For, what time ſince the beginning of <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> what place, what thing doth not bear witneſſe to the <hi>Catholike Faith? Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.4. that the neck of the Spouſe the Church, is like the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> builded for an armory, whereon there hang a thouſand ſhields, a thouſand arguments of defence of the <hi>Catholike Doctrines;</hi> which the many excellent bookes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie written both by thoſe of our own and other Nations, doe moſt abundantly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105178:11"/> declare. It ſhall therefore ſuffice me to ſay only ſo much, as may witneſſe that I did not make this change without ſufficient Motives: wherein I will make choice of a little of much, and ſay as much as I can in a little.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Entring then into a ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the end for which I and all men were created, to wit, the glory of God, and our owne eternall happineſſe; and of the knowledge of the meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereunto, I found that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> this was not to be gotten by cleer &amp; evident ſight, nor by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſcourſe founded on the principles of reaſon, nor by reliance upon authority meerly humane; but only by Faith ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the word of God, revealing unto men things that are otherwiſe only known to his infinite wiſedome. Secondly that God revealed all theſe things to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and he to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 15.15. <hi>All things which I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you;</hi> and this partly by word of mouth, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by the immediate teaching of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> to the end that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them unto mankind, to be received, believed, and obeyed over the whole world,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105178:11"/> even to the end thereof; as he ſaith, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe teach all nations.</hi> Thirdly that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did accordingly preach to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, Chap. 16.20. <hi>They going forth preached everywhere.</hi> And planted an univerſall Chriſtian company, charging them to keepe inviolably, and to deliver unto their poſterity what they had received of them the firſt meſſengers of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to, <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The things that thou haſt heard of me amongſt many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, who may inſtruct others.</hi> Fourthly that though the <hi>Apostles</hi> &amp; their hearers be departed out of this life, yet there ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines a meanes in the world, by which all men may aſſuredly know what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preached, and the primitive <hi>Church</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them, ſeeing the <hi>Church</hi> to the worlds end muſt be built on the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and beleive nothing as matter of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which was delivered of them; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>and are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt being the chiefe corner ſtone.</hi>

                  <p>Of the meanes to know, which is the Word of God.

               <p n="1">§. 1. THeſe things being ſuppoſed, the chief difficulty to my ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in this, how we might certainly know now adaies, ſo many ages after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> death, what, &amp; all neceſſary points that they taught and preached: the <hi>Protestants</hi> ſaid that this was to be found in the Scriptures which were written by them; but this did not ſatisfie my doubt; for suppoſing the Scriptures to be the word of God, delivered by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by him, yet I wanted ſome ſufficient witneſſe or proofe to aſſure me ſo much, for of my ſelfe I could not find it. The bare word of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> I ſaw I had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to take, becauſe they confeſſe that they may erre, and I in this matter not being able to diſcover whether they did erre or no, relying upon a fallible guide muſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105178:12"/> remaine in uncertainty and fear. I obſerved moreover that although in moſt of their aſſertions they might upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation prove falſe; yet in ſaying that the <hi>Church</hi> might erre, and taking themſelves for the <hi>Church,</hi> they had ſaid moſt true; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they indeed had erred in this moſt important Particular of declareing what is the word of God and what not; the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> affirming much leſſe for the word of God then the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England</hi> doth.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105178:13"/> to an agreement in the quantity thereof. But I further weighed them particularly, the principall whereof are theſe.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Firſt, they ſay the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are knowne to be divine by their owne light ſhining in them,<note place="margin">Cal. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Inſt. cap. <hi>7.</hi> Sect. <hi>2.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine.</note> 
                  <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as ſweet and bitter are knowne by the taſt, white and blacke by the ſight:</hi> which aſſertion to me ſeemed very abſurd. I confeſſe indeed much of the Scripture is but the amplification of the Morall Law, which is a knowledge engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in man by nature, by the light whereof we may ſee that it is true; but this proves it not to be <hi>the Word of God.</hi> For though all truth be from God, as he is the prime verity, and ſo may be called in ſome ſenſe, <hi>his Word:</hi> yet by the Word of God in this caſe is meant, truth revealed by God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately unto the pen-men thereof: and though we find much thereof to be true, as agreeing with the engrafted principles of reaſon, yet this proveth not that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed immediately and extraordinarily, which is the circumſtance that makes it the Word of God, in the ſenſe of thoſe that diſpute about it. As for the hiſtorical parts both of the Old and New <hi>Teſtament,</hi> the inſtitution of Sacraments, with the like,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105178:13"/> they have no affinity with the in-born prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon, and are therefore not knowne to be ſo much as true by any light they carry with them, much leſſe to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily revealed by God, and ſo to be his Word. Beſides, if it could be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what were the Word of God, and what not, by the reſplendent light thereof, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as the light is knowne from darkneſſe, (as ſome of them ſay) how could there be ſo much diſſention about the parts thereof, as it is knowne there is? the <hi>Calvinists</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more to be the Word of God then the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do, and leſſe then the <hi>Catholikes:</hi> and yet if it ſhew it ſelfe by its owne light, the Turks may ſee it, as well as any of them.</p>
               <p>And heere I obſerved that many had blinded themſelves with looking on the light, and could not ſee ſo far as to diſcern between corporall and ſpirituall light, but becauſe the <hi>Prophet David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thy word is a lanterne unto my feet and a light unto my paths, Pſal.</hi> 118.105. they conceived the Scripture was as eaſily diſcerned by its own light as the Sun. True it is that every corporall light that doth enlighten the eye of the body muſt be evident in it ſelfe, and originally cleer, but not ſo every truth that doth illuſtrate mens underſtanding. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105178:14"/> reaſon is, becauſe the eye of the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by things ſeen inferre and conclude things that are hidden, but can only appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what doth directly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſhew it ſelfe: but mans underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehends not only what ſhewes it ſelfe, but by things knowne inferres and breeds in it ſelfe the knowledge of things hidden. Hence though things ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves directly and by their own light, be prime principles of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the meanes to know other things; yet alſo things hidden in themſelves being formerly known by the light of authority, may thereby become lights, that is, meanes to encreaſe our knowledge of hidden things. So that ſpeaking of ſpirituall and intellectuall lights, it is falſe that all lights that enlighten mans underſtanding to know other things, are evident in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yea ſome ſecondary principles and lights there are, which muſt be ſhewed by a ſuperiour light, before they become lights themſelves. In which kind is the Scripture, being a light only to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe known by the <hi>Churches Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be from the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> authority confirmed by miracles, to be of God; by Gods ſupreme verity, who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105178:14"/> cannot deceive nor be deceived, to be the truth. Moreover this conceipt of theirs doth utterly extinguiſh faith, and beleife of the word of God; for every thing is ſo far forth the object of faith, that it is not ſeen, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Faith is the argument of things not ſeen, Hebr.</hi> 11.1.<note place="margin">In Evang.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105178:16"/> contradictions; ſome places are not fully anſwered, but the <hi>Fathers</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly from literall to allegoricall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as appeares particularly in the foure firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and in the reconciling of the <hi>Chronologies</hi> of the <hi>Kings.</hi> And ſeeing no man is infallibly ſure, that all the anſwers uſed to reconcile the ſeeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scriptures are true, no man can be aſſured by the evidence of the thing, that there is this perfect harmony in them; nor conſequently, that they are thereby knowne to be the Word of God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if we were infallibly aſſured, that there were this perfect harmony in the Scriptures, yet this to me ſeemed not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofe that they are the Word of God, becauſe there is no reaſon forbids me to believe, that it may not be alſo found in the writings of ſome men; yea I make no queſtion, but it is to be found, and that with leſſe ſeeming contradiction then is in the Scripture; yet no man accounts that this proves their writings to be the Word of God. Neither as I ſaw, could theſe pretences, before mentioned, be laid hold on by the unlearned multitude, an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company whereof cannot read at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105178:16"/> all, and when they heare them read, if they were asked, would ſay, that they ſee not this light, this majeſtie, ſtile and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which their learned men talk of, nor do they know what it meanes, nor that a tittle of it is the word of God, but only becauſe they are told ſo; Indeed S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in the behalf of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>That holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But we are as uncertaine by any thing in the words themſelves, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid this, as of all the reſt, that is altogether.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. So that I could not find that there was any more then probable arguments to be drawn from the Scriptures themſelves to prove them to be the word of God. For that which is the word of God, and the rule of faith, muſt be certaine not only in ſome parts, but in every part and particle, book, chapter, and line thereof, which is impoſſible to be knowne by the light and evidence of the ſenſe and doctrine, ſeeing many places even by<note n="*" place="margin">Field of the Church lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>15.</hi> VVhites Reply. p. <hi>35</hi>

So that upon theſe conſiderations I ſaw no evident certainty out of the Scriptures that they were the Word of God; but that they are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſuch without being ſeen, upon ſome other Word of God, more cleerly appearing to be the Word of God, and leſſe liable to corruption then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, aſſuring us ſo much, and that is the <hi>Tradition of the Church:</hi> according to the ſaying of S.

               <p n="8">§. 8. Laſtly, ſome ſay, they know the Scripture to be the Word of God, by the Spirit of God prompting it to their ſoules. And this of all the reſt ſeemed to me moſt abſurd. For firſt, I durſt not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate this Spirit to my ſelf, nor could I know it was in any other. His ſaying, the Spirit told him the Scripture was the Word of God, did not prove it, nor had I reaſon to believe he had the Spirit more than I, without ſome proof. If a mans te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in his owne caſe might thus be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I ſaw that no <hi>Heretique</hi> would want it to ſupport his impiety, by aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it to the Spirit, as<note n="*" place="margin">Epiphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haer. <hi>21.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105178:18"/> of the Spirit to their private fancies. If I ſhould have ſaid, that I know by the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> that this or that part of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or that none of it was the Word of God, my proof was as good to him, as his to me. For although the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit of God be a ſure wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to him that hath it, yet it is none to others, unleſſe he can prove he hath it, by ſome miraculous effect. And without this kind of proof every prudent man hath reaſon to believe that ſuch a boaſter is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and intends to deceive others (as it is likely of the firſt Authors of Hereſies) or elſe that he deceives himſelfe by a ſtrong operation of his fancy, which he calls the <hi>Spirit;</hi> becauſe he is told by the doctrine of ſome <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that he muſt feel that he hath the <hi>Spirit,</hi> (as in particular concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the aſſurance of his ſalvation) deſirous then to be in the right way, that which he would have, he perſwades himſelf he hath, becauſe elſe he finds himſelfe at a loſſe, which begets a horror in him. Which to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, he flies to this pitifull refuge, being the beſt he is inſtructed to, that he may have ſome ſtay for his belief, and repoſe for his ſoul. And this happens common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and moſt ſtrongly to thoſe that have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105178:18"/> ſome zeal, but little wit; on whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reflection of their fancy is the ſtronger, and works upon them, as upon ſome I have read and heard of, who by their eager deſire to be ſo, have ſtrongly conceited themſelves to be indeed Kings and Princes, and other kind of great and rich men, when truly, and in all other mens judgements, they were either mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or fools. So that this I perceived was to open a gap to any mans fantaſticall pretence whatſoever, who had the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to aſcribe it to the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any peaceable way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the differences amongſt men of this nature; for each one pretending the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he hath no reaſon to yeeld to another, the holy Spirit being an infallible director whereſoever it is; yet when it is different in different men who pretend to it, as it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falls out, it is a certaine ſigne that one of them is deceived, and both are deceived in the opinion of each other; yet neither yeelding to other, the contention ends in the action of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> againſt the <hi>Prophet Micheas,</hi> who gave him a box on the eare and ſaid. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Which way paſſed the Spirit of our Lord from me, that it ſhould ſpeake to thee.</hi> And ſo it hath fallen out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

                  <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> to avoid their dependence on the <hi>Church</hi> for the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof, ſay, that all things neceſſity to ſalvation are eaſie to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105178:22"/> be underſtood, even by the moſt unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reader. But they never yet expreſſed what points were neceſſary to ſalvation and what not, nor have given any rule by by which it might be found out, but have left themſelves the liberty of adding to, or ſubſtracting from that title, what and whenſoever they pleaſed. And who ſeeth not that, with this device, they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (if they pleaſe) almoſt all the points of Chriſtian belief and practiſe?</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Wonderfull confuſion I found herein; for here the underſtanding of the moſt unlearned Reader is made the ſize of things neceſſary to ſalvation: and if it be a meaſure unto all men, then the moſt learned Clerk is bound to believe no more than the moſt unlearned peaſant that can but read; and the moſt unlearned need not the help of the learned for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of things neceſſary, but can find them out by his own reading. So that you muſt take the arranteſt dunce in their <hi>Church</hi> that can read, and after he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently peruſed the Bible, and prayed for underſtanding therein, that which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, muſt be accounted neceſſary to ſalvation, and no more. Surely me thinks they are to blame, that have not for the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105178:23"/> greater credit and cleerneſſe of their cauſe, made this tryall upon ſome ſilly fellow, and from his mouth have ſet downe their points neceſſary to ſalvation. But by this it appears that they are willing to draw the matters neceſſary to ſalvation, for their great eaſe, into a very narrow compaſſe, and make the ſame meaſure ſerve the ſillieſt clown and the greateſt Clerk, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly. And (coming cloſer to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) I have known ſome affirm, (which I believe is the opinion of very many) that to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct belief of his divine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that he died for the ſinnes of the world, and that a man muſt repent before he die, is all that is neceſſarily required ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for belief or practice of any man. As for thoſe that cannot read, which are I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the greateſt number, or very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, they deal moſt unkindly with them, not providing a certaine means whereby they may be brought up to read, which they that can read think all are bound to, with references to the Scriptures, by the commandement of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and wherby they are to find out the things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but leave them (if at all) to be ſaved by the cruell blind Popery (as they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105178:23"/> pleaſe to call it) of an implicite faith.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. I then conſidered that there was much ambiguity in theſe words, <hi>[neceſſary to ſalvation]</hi> there being divers kinds of neceſſity that have place in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Firſt there is an <hi>abſolute neceſſity,</hi> and a <hi>conditionall neceſſity; Abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> is that which admits no excuſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, nor any exception of place, time, or perſon; as in regard of thoſe that are of age capable of knowledge: The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Christ</hi> mediator betwixt God and man: and to this kind of neceſſity there are ſome that would reſtrain all things to be believed, leaving themſelves the liberty of all matters elſe to believe what they pleaſe: but with as much reaſon they may reſtraine this neceſſity to the believing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is a God, and ſo renounce their Chriſtianity. <hi>Conditionall neceſſity</hi> is that which obligeth not, but in caſe of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, and receives exception of time, place and perſon: Thus there are many points neceſſary to be believed, if a man be in place where he may be inſtructed in them, and hath time to receive inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are not neceſſary for a man live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wilderneſſe, or ſo ready to be attached by death, as he hath no leiſure
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105178:24"/> to be inſtructed, or apprehenſion to receive it; as that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was borne of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and crucified under <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> And many things are neceſſary for Paſtors to believe, which are not for common people; as that the perſons of the <hi>Trinity</hi> are the ſame in eſſence, but diſtinct in ſubſiſtence; that in <hi>Chriſt</hi> there are two natures, and but one perſon, with many the like: And in matter of practiſe, there are many things neceſſary in caſe of poſſibility, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of time, and place, which are not neceſſary, if the conveniency to accompliſh them be wanting: as the aſſiſtance at <hi>Church ſervice,</hi> and participation of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>neceſſity of means;</hi> and a <hi>neceſſity of precept; Neceſſity of means</hi> is in thoſe things to which God hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged us, if we will attaine the end; as of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> to which God hath given power to confer grace; and of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> whoſe neceſſity is impoſed upon us, if we will enter into life; and of repentance of ſinnes, which is a means ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obtain their remiſſion. <hi>Neceſſity of Precept</hi> is that which only obliges in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it is commanded, contributing otherwiſe no real advancement to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105178:24"/> as the celebrating the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and other ſuch like obſervations; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion wherof could be no hindrance to ſalvation, but in reſpect of diſobedience and breach of the <hi>Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly there is a <hi>neceſſity of ſpeciall belief,</hi> and a <hi>neceſſity of generall belief: Neceſſity of ſpeciall belief</hi> is of thoſe points which all faithfull (if they be not prevented by death) are obliged to believe with faith expreſſe, diſtinct, &amp; determinate, which the Schoolemen call <hi>explicite faith;</hi> as the twelve Articles of the <hi>Creed. Neceſſity of generall belief</hi> is of thoſe things which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular man is not bound to believe with a diſtinct and explicite faith; as that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> given by <hi>Heretiques,</hi> is true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and that Heretiques which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> muſt not be baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when they return to the <hi>Church,</hi> with many ſuch like; in which it will ſuffice the unlearned multitude to believe them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, that is, to adhere to the <hi>Church</hi> that doth believe them, and by a generall belief imbrace them, by believing as the Church doth, and referring themſelves to her, prepared alwaies to believe them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly when they ſhall be declared to them, and themſelves are capable to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:105178:25"/>
               <p>Laſtly, there is a <hi>Neceſſity of act,</hi> and a <hi>Neceſſity of approbation: Neceſſity of act</hi> is of thoſe things which every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is obliged actually to perform; as to profeſſe the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> to forgive offences commited againſt him, with the like. <hi>Neceſſity of approbation</hi> is of thoſe things which every man is not bound actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to performe, but only not to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them, nor to condemne thoſe that do them, nor the <hi>Church</hi> that allowes them, nor to ſeperate themſelves from her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion; as the choice to live in virginity and ſingle life, with the like.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Now according to theſe ſeverall kinds of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> I accounted it meet to hold for neceſſary to ſalvation, all thoſe things that the <hi>Fathers</hi> have holden neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in that degree, and according to thoſe kinds of neceſſity, as they have holden them. And this I did not perceive to be a matter of ſuch eaſe to find out, as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> did under their title of <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation</hi> affirm. I found innumerable places of Scripture were obſcure and hard to be underſtood; and that their diſtinction of things neceſſary to ſalvation was more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and uncertain than any thing; having no limits or determination, but like the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105178:25"/> 
                  <hi>Gladius Delphicus,</hi> was fitted for all turns, but indeed ſerved none, but to cozen themſelves; who, preſented with a point of belief or practice which they did not like, would wave it with ſaying, <hi>it was not neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> Therefore as S. <hi>Philip</hi> asked the <hi>Eunuch, whether he underſtood what he read;</hi> who ſaid, <hi>how can I, without ſome body to interpret it?</hi> So I anſwered my ſelfe, and had reaſon to believe that others could not truly anſwer better for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>An interpreter then was neceſſary who might judge of the true meaning of the Scripture, againſt the corruption of <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> who all take their protection from thence; and which ſhould determine all emergent controverſies, which were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the preſervation of peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And in beſtowing of this Office I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> voices were divided;<note n="*" place="margin">Har. Confeſ. p. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> ſome gave it to the Scripture it ſelfe, ſaying that it muſt interpret it ſelfe, and be the Judg of all controverſies.<note n="*" place="margin">VVhites way to the Church, p. <hi>6.27.</hi>
                  </note> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that the Spirit of God doth interpret to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private man, both which I apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded abſurd and unreaſonable. The former,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105178:26"/> becauſe nothing (if it ſpeak obſcurely) can interpret it ſelfe, but that which hath a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving voice, which the Scripture not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, cannot poſſibly interpret it ſelfe. As for the aſſertion of ſome, that the obſcure places are interpreted by plain places ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the ſame purpoſe, it is falſe; there being no ſuch plaine places in many caſes to be found, which they themſelves prove by their diſagreement about the ſenſe of many places. Therefore to allay the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſſe of this aſſertion, they add, that it is Scripture diligently read by us, and one place conferred with another, all circumſtances weighed, and much prayer u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which is in effect, that (not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, but) they interpret the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the aforeſaid meanes.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. But all theſe waies of ſtudy, and conference, skill in the tongues, or the like, are but humane endeavours, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to error, yea though much fervour of prayer be mixed therewith; and ſuch as the meanes are, ſuch of neceſſity muſt be the interpretation and determination; but the meanes are uncertaine, doubtfull and fallible, therefore ſuch muſt be the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; and if it be uncertaine, it may be falſe; and whether it be ſo or no, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:105178:26"/> have no way to diſcover, but by the Spirit, as he inſtructs every particular man; whoſe inſufficiency I found in my former conſideration of the meanes to know the Scripture to be the Word of God. And if it cannot aſſure me of the letter of Gods Word, no more can it of the meaning; conſidering that I can neither know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another have the Spirit, nor yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have it my ſelfe or no, without ſome miraculous revelation: for all other proofs of having the direction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are but humane, and ſo ſubject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, but miracles we are ſure are from God, becauſe they exceed all humane and created power.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. And ſeeing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ground their ſalvation upon faith onely, which as they ſay, doth onely juſtifie; and faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture only, which according to them, containes all things neceſſary to be believed; and the Scripture and ſenſe thereof upon the private Spirit only, by which they expound the Scripture; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that the private Spirit is the ſole or principall ground to them of the ſenſe of Scripture; the Scriptures ſenſe the like ground of their faith; and this their faith the like ground of their ſalvation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105178:27"/> no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can have greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his faith or ſalvation, then he hath of this private Spirit, whereof ſeeing he hath none, either from <hi>Scripture, Church, Councells, Fathers,</hi> common ſenſe or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, it muſt needs follow that he hath certainty of nothing: and that this rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the private Spirit muſt needs plunge him into infinite and abominable errors.</p>

                  <p>Of the vanity and impiety of thoſe, who affirm, that each mans particular reaſon is the laſt Judge and Interpreter of Scripture, and his guide in all things, which he is bound to believe and know. And that the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> is the ſole Judge.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. FInally, <hi>Chillingworth</hi> the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former and calciner of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion,</hi> ſeeing the weakneſſe of all the former pretences, hath boldly and roundly reduced all to one only principle, and that is of naturall reaſon: affirming that our belief of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the Word of God; and alſo our belief of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in every particular part thereof, depends upon each mans reaſon and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105178:27"/> diſcourſe, beyond which, or different from which, he is not bound to believe a title. Yet he doth not ſay that this way is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but becauſe all wayes elſe are fallible (as he ſuppoſes) and this the onely way God hath given us to be guided by, we muſt be herewith contented, and God alſo muſt be contented herewith in us, and give ſalvation to thoſe that believe and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their beſt underſtanding. And this opinion I obſerved had got a large poſſeſſion in the minds of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> whoſe ingenuous education gave them the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt claime to the exerciſe of reaſon: who were therefore very glad to embrace ſuch a principle of <hi>Religion,</hi> as of which they accounted themſelves the chiefeſt Maſters.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. This conceipt ſeemed to me no leſſe abſurd, and much more inſolent than any of the other; for the other did ſeem at leaſt to aſcribe our knowledge of the Scripture and ſenſe thereof to God, either ſpeaking in the Scripture, or by his Spirit ſpeaking to their ſoules, or concurring with their humane endeavours; though in concluſion they drew it to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of their owne fancies. But this man more impiouſly hardy than all that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105178:28"/> went before him, doth directly and in plaine termes attribute all the aſſurance we have of the Word of God (the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to ſalvation) unto our ſelves, and that too, as we are meer men. And this reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of faith not into Authority, but into reaſon, and that not as preparing or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing us to believe (which <hi>Catholiques</hi> allow) but as the maine ground and ſtrongeſt pillar of our faith, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of faith upon reaſon, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion on the premiſes, is a doctrine incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly pernicious, and the ſource of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous impieties.

               <p>Therefore as an inſtance to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>We have as great reaſon to believe there was ſuch a man as Henry the eight King of England, as that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under Pontius Pilate.</hi> And in larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105178:28"/> of this his doctrine he ſaith, <hi>If up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reaſons ſeeming to my underſtanding very good, I have made choice of a guide or rule for my directions in matters of faith; when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I diſcover that this guide or rule leads me to believe one or more points, which in the beſt judgement that I can frame, I have ſtronger reaſon to reject, than I had to accept my former rule, I may and ought to forſake that rule as falſe and erroneous; otherwiſe I ſhould be convinced not to follow reaſon, but ſome ſetled reſolution to hold fast whatſoever I had once apprehended.</hi> From which wild and vaſt principle doth follow, that if the Scripture (for example) propound things ſeeming more contrary to any mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and opinion, than the inducements which firſt moved him to believe Scripture, were in his opinion ſtrong and convincing, he muſt reject the Scripture as an erroneus rule, and adhere to his owne reaſon and diſcourſe, as his laſt and ſafeſt guide. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that (according to him) the motives for which we believe the Scripture are but probable, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſubject to falſhood; which in all reaſon muſt give place to reaſons ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demonſtrative and convincing; as there will not want many ſuch, againſt the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105178:29"/> higheſt myſteries of <hi>Chriſtian faith,</hi> if once we profeſſe our aſſent to them, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into natural diſcourſe; For, for what reaſon do the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and ſuch like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the miſteries of the <hi>bleſſed Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Diety</hi> of our <hi>bleſſed Saviour,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points, but only becauſe they ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant unto reaſon? And in theſe horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinions do theſe reaſonably unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men fall by juſt conſequence from their owne principles.</p>
               <p>For if (as they ſay) there be no <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church</hi> aſſiſted with <hi>Infallibility,</hi> fit to teach any man even ſuch Articles as they count fundamentall, and neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but that in every particular, even one may, and muſt follow the direction of his owne reaſon, be he never ſo unlearned; what will follow but an unhappy liberty, yea, neceſſity for men to reject the higheſt and moſt divine myſteries of <hi>Chriſtian faith,</hi> unleſſe they can compoſe all repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies after an intelligible manner (as he ſpeaks) even to every ignorant and ſimple perſon, which is impoſſible; or els ſay that it is reaſonable for men to believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions at the ſame time, which (as he ſaith) is very unreaſonable. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in true Philoſophy, the objections
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105178:29"/> which may be made againſt the myſtery of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity</hi> and the <hi>Incarnation of God,</hi> are much more difficult, than any that can be brought againſt <hi>Tranſubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;</hi> he then that will follow theſe new principles, muſt, if he deny the one, deny the other alſo; which as yet the greateſt part of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not do; in time perhaps they may: or which is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, obſerving the impiety of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confeſſe both.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. This I conceive was the reaſon why S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did preach fooliſhneſſe in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> namely becauſe they ſought wiſdome; and what was that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but humane, the dictates of naturall reaſon? which the myſteries of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> exceeding, they counted them fooliſhneſſe: but to thoſe that were called, it was the power of God, and the wiſdome of God. By which it appears that the wiſdome of God, and the wiſdome of the <hi>Grecians</hi> which was humane wiſdome, the light of naturall reaſon and diſcourſe, were very different; wherein the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives (as it is meet theſe wiſe men ſhould do) the preheminence to God; for that which ſeems fooliſh in God, is wiſer than what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105178:30"/> is in men; and ſo the myſteries of faith, which ſeem ſo contrary to humane reaſon, have more wiſdome in them, than their reaſons have that oppoſe them; who do therefore but prove themſelves <hi>cum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione inſanire,</hi> to be mad with reaſon. This doctrine alſo of giving reaſon the tribunall in matters of faith, and that, as it is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular man, is an inlet for every man to be of a ſeverall <hi>Religion,</hi> by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from others in what points ſoever, according to the direction of his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yea poſſibly to be of no <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> at all.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105178:34"/> they rend and teare her in pieces; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of embracing the <hi>Church,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in unity, they embrace <hi>Schiſm</hi> and Diviſion, which is the death and ruin of the <hi>Church.</hi>

               <p n="2">§. 2.

But thoſe that are ſo preſumptuous (as very many are) to aſſume unto themſelves the aſſurance of their predeſtination, do eaſily lay hold on this tenure, which they do the more boldly, by how much it is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for another to diſprove; but as it is not eaſie for another to diſprove, ſo it is as hard for them to prove; and concludes nothing therefore in the behalf of the <hi>Churches</hi> deſcription in generall, or of their ſhare in particular. Beſide, the word <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,

               <p>Now predeſtinaton, as it is meere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, eſtabliſheth nothing in the predeſtinate, nor is it made in them, but in God only; and by conſequence doth not make them actuall parts of the ſociety cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Church.</hi> It is not the union of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, but of vocation that builds men into a <hi>Church.</hi> By the later defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Church,</hi> they deny the very being of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſme;</hi> for if the whole Maſſe of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be the <hi>Church,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the errors in faith which ſome of them hold, or ſeparation in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they make, then there are none that can be called <hi>Heretiques</hi> or <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques;</hi> or elſe (which is equally abſurd) all <hi>Heretiques</hi> and <hi>Schiſmatiques</hi> are of the <hi>Church;</hi> and this deſtroyes the holineſſe of the <hi>Church</hi> in doctrine, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſeparable ornament thereof.

               <p n="1">§. 1. NOw that the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> (which ſociety of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſoever it be, of which we ſhall deliberate hereafter) is the only faithfull and true witneſſe of the matter of Gods Word, to tell us what it is and what is not it; the only true interpreter of the meaning of Gods word, and the laſt and finall judge of all controverſies that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> and that ſhee is not onely true, but that ſhee cannot be otherwiſe ſeeing ſhee is infallible, I was perſwaded to believe by many reaſons.

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, then without dependence on the Scripture, I conceived the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> to be infallible in her Traditions, in that which ſhe declareth to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> and that even in the very nature of her teſtimony and tradition: For Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being a full report of what was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to ſenſe, namely what doctrines the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> taught, what Scripture they wrote, it is impoſſible it ſhould be falſe.

Thirdly, God being the <hi>Prime Verity,</hi> he cannot ſo much as connive at falſhood, whereby he becomes acceſſory of deceiving them, who ſimply, readily, and religiouſly believe what they have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think to be his Word: but there is moſt juſt and ſufficient reaſon to believe that the doctrine delivered by full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Tradition, from hand to hand, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> is undoubtedly their doctrine, and the Word of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105178:41"/> he cannot ſuffer <hi>Catholique Tradition</hi> to be falſified. Nor can (as I conceive) any prudent man imagine that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent his Son into the world, to teach men the way to heaven, every moment of whoſe life was made notable, by doing or ſuffering ſomthing to that end, ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the efficacy and power thereof to be extinguiſhed, by permitting damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the whole <hi>Church,</hi> and that ſoon after his departure, (as ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay) and not to recover light for twelve or fourteen hundred years together; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſidering there was no poſſible meanes for any man to know the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; there was no ſociety of men that taught otherwiſe, and if at any time there ſtarted up any, they were condemned of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by all their fellow-<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and in proceſſe of time melted from the face of the earth: The <hi>Scripture</hi> (if that were the means, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> pretend) not being printed, the invention of Printing not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world till about two hundred years ago; and the Bibles that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten being but few, by reaſon of the great labour of writing them; and thoſe that were, not purchaſeable but by few, becauſe of their price, nor legible but by fewer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105178:41"/> they were not printed, but written; and laſtly, not to be knowne to be the Word of God (as I have ſhewed before) but by the teſtimony of thoſe men, who (they ſay) were corrupted; who having corrupted the doctrine, might with much more eaſe have extinguiſhed, or corrupted the Text, and made them ſpeak what they pleaſed, it being known to far fewer than the doctrine was; it being difficult to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, uncertain whether it were right, and very obſcure in its meaning; ſo that if they had been guilty of changing the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> doctrine, they could eaſily have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed out all thoſe places which <hi>Protestants</hi> urge againſt them, and ſo have prevented the ſtrange and notable diſcovery that the <hi>Protestants</hi> think they have made of their errors. And if they ſay that God by his providence preſerved the Scripture both from extinction and corruption; may not we much more reaſonably ſay, (having warrant for it out of the <hi>Scripture</hi> alſo, whereas they have no warrant for the preſervation of the Text) that God by the ſame providence did, and will alwaies preſerve his <hi>Church</hi> from corruption, which is a thing much more eaſily known than the <hi>Scripture,</hi> &amp; conſiſting of a living mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105178:42"/> can expreſſe it ſelf more plainly: This <hi>infallibility</hi> in the mouth and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> aſſureth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>My Spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed from hence forth for ever.</hi> And therfore S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Aug.

               <p n="4">§. 4. To know divine and ſupernaturall truth by the light and luſtre of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, belongs to the <hi>Church triumphant;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſurance without an externall infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ground, is proper to <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the firſt publiſhers of <hi>Religion:</hi> and ſeeing that God doth not now inſtruct either of theſe waies (as I have ſhewed) but by an externall infallible ground, and this being the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> it followes, that he muſt preſerve it from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and likewiſe render the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelfe alwaies conſpicuous that it may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſenſible markes, of which we ſhall ſpeake anon. And he is alſo bound by his providence, to aſſiſt men in the finding out of this <hi>Church,</hi> when they apply their beſt diligence thereunto, that ſo they be not deceived.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:105178:42"/>
               <p>And whereas ſome of the more learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, that though they have no infallible ground, beſides the teaching of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet they are not taught imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by propheticall manner, becauſe they are alſo taught by an externall probable, though not infallible motive; to wit, the <hi>Churches tradition;</hi> I conceive that except they aſſigne an externall infallible meanes beſides Gods inward teaching, they cannot avoid the challenging of immediate revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For whoſoever knowes things aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly by the inward teaching of the Spirit, without an externall infallible motive, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he doth adhere is aſſured prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, though he have ſome externall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable motives to direct his belief. S. <hi>Peter</hi> had ſome come conjecturall ſignes of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> his preverſeneſſe and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible malice, yet ſeeing he knew it aſſuredly, we believe he knew it by the light of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, becauſe beſide inward aſſurance he had no externall infallible ground. If one ſee a man give almes publiquely, though he ſee probable ſignes and tokens that he doth it out of vaine glory, yet cannot he be ſure thereof, but by the light of immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, becauſe the other tokens are not grounds ſufficient to make him certain.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105178:43"/> For if a man be ſure, and have no certain ground of this aſſurance out of his own heart, it is cleer, that he is aſſured imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and only by Gods inward inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> if they will diſclaime immediate revelation in deed, &amp; not in words only, they muſt either grant <hi>Tradition</hi> to be <hi>infallible,</hi> or elſe aſſigne ſome externall infallible ground beſides <hi>Tradition,</hi> whereby they are taught what Scriptures the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> delivered.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I was perſwaded of the <hi>Churches infallibility</hi> in her Traditions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, becauſe ſhe is endowed with the power of miracles; which whereſoere they are (which I ſhall hereafter examine) do both prove, that that ſociety of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is the true <hi>Church,</hi> and that that <hi>Church</hi> is infallible in all that ſhe propoſes as the Word of God. And the reaſon is, becauſe God (who is truth it ſelf) cannot ſet his hand and ſeal, that is miracles, and works proper to himſelf, to warrant and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize a falſhood invented by men.

                  <hi>Protestants</hi> object and ſay, <hi>that miracles are only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and not ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of divine doctrine;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging <hi>Bellarmine</hi> who ſaith, we cannot
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105178:43"/> know evidently that miracles are true, for if we did, we ſhould know evidently that our faith is true, and ſo it ſhould not be faith. To which may be anſwered, that ſuch evidence as doth exclude the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of pious affection, and reverence to Gods Word, evidence that (conſidering the imperfection of humane underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) may enforce men to believe, cannot ſtand with true faith. If we know by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall</hi> or <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> evidence, that the miracles done in the <hi>Church</hi> were true, this evidence would compell men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to overcome the naturall obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſeeming impoſſibility of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Doctrine; therefore as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> ſaith, we cannot be Mathematically and altogether infallibly ſure by the light of nature, that miracles are true. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it cannot be denied in reaſon, what our Saviour affirmes, that miracles are a ſufficient teſtimony binding men to believe, <hi>the very works that I do, do bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of me, that the Father hath ſent me, Joh.</hi> 5.36. and conſequently that we may know them to be true by Phyſicall evidence, as we are ſure of things we ſee with our eyes, and handle with our hands; as S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 Epiſt. 1.1. <hi>what we have ſeen with our eyes,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105178:44"/> what we have beheld, and our hands have handled of the word of life.</hi> Or we may be as ſure of Miracles, as we are of ſuch things as being once evident to the world, are by the worlds full report declared unto us; which is a morall infallibility. So that if we have not a Metaphyſicall or Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall infallibility of the truth of Miracles, yet we have a Phyſicall and morall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, as much as we have of any thing we either hear or ſee.</p>
               <p>Nor doth this Phyſicall evidence take away the merit of faith, becauſe this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not being altogether and in the higheſt degree infallible in it ſelf (for our ſenſes may ſomtimes be deceived) it is not ſufficient to conquer the naturall obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, darkneſſe, and ſeeming falſhood of things to be believed, upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thoſe miracles. For the myſtery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation, Reall preſence,</hi> and the like, ſeem as far above the reach of reaſon as any Miracle can ſeem evident to ſenſe; hence when faith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Miracles, there ariſeth a conflict betwixt the ſeeming evidence of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and the ſeeming falſhood and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Catholique Doctrine;</hi> againſt which obſcurity a man cannot get the victory by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105178:44"/> the ſole evidence of miracles, except he be inwardly aſſiſted by the light of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, moving him by pious affection to cleave to the Doctrine, which is by ſo cleer teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony proved to be his Word. Even as a man ſhut up in a chamber, with two lights, whereof the one makes the wall ſeem white, the other blew, cannot be firmly aſſured what colour it is untill day-light enter, and obſcuring both thoſe lights, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truth: ſo a man looking upon Chriſtian Doctrines, by the light of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles done to prove them, will be moved to judge them to be truth; but looking upon them through the evidence of their ſeeming impoſſibilities unto reaſon, they will ſeem falſe: nor will he be able firmly to reſolve for the ſide of faith, untill the light of divine grace enter into his heart, making him prefer, through pious reverence to God, the ſo-propoſed authority of his Word, before the ſeeming impoſſibility to mans reaſon.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That <hi>Catholique Tradition</hi> is the onely firm foundation and motive to induce us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> received their doctrine from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from God the Father; And what are the meanes, by which this doctrine is derived downe to us.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. AS <hi>Catholique Tradition</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in it ſelf, ſo is it moſt neceſſary for us, there being no other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine teſtimony to any prudent man, no firme ground or motive to believe, that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> received her doctrine from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> from <hi>Chriſt, Chriſt</hi> from God; nor no way to bring it downe from thoſe times to theſe, but only the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> For we may obſerve three properties of the doctrine of faith; to be true, to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, to be preached and delivered by the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> The higheſt ground by which a man is perſuaded that his faith is true, is the authority of God ſpeaking and revealing it; the higheſt proof by which a man is aſſured that his faith is revealed, is the authority of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:105178:48"/> who delivered the ſame, as deſcending from God; but the higheſt ground that moveth a man to believe that his faith was preached by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> is the perpetuall <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> ſucceeding the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> unto this day, aſſuring him ſo much; according to the ſaying of<note n="*" place="margin">De praeſcr. c. <hi>21.</hi> &amp; <hi>37.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who maketh this ladder of belief in this ſort; <hi>what I believe, I received from the preſent Church, the preſent from the Primitive, the Primitive Church from the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles from Chriſt, Chriſt from God, and God the prime verity, from no other fountaine different from his own infallible knowledge:</hi> So that he that cleaveth not to the preſent <hi>Church,</hi> firmely believing the <hi>Tradition</hi> thereof, as being come down by ſucceſſion, is not ſo much as on the loweſt ſtep of the ladder that leads unto God, the revealer of ſaving truth; ſucceſſive <hi>Tradition</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written being the laſt and finall ground whereon we believe that the points of our belief came from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which may be proved by theſe arguments.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Firſt, if the maine points of faith be to be believed to come from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> becauſe they are written in <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are believed to be the Word
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105178:49"/> of God, upon the report of univerſall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then our belief that the things which we believe come from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and from God, reſteth upon the Tradition of the <hi>Church;</hi> but it is moſt certaine that the Scriptures cannot be proved to have been delivered unto the <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but by the perpetuall Tradition unwritten conſerved in the <hi>Church</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> all the other waies by which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> endeavour to prove the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the word of God being vaine and inſufficient, as I have proved before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, common and unlearned peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which comprehend the greateſt part of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> may have true faith, yet they cannot have it grounded on the <hi>Scripture,</hi> for they can neither underſtand, nor read it; or if read it, yet but in a vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, of the truth of whoſe tranſlation they are not aſſured, therefore muſt rely upon the teſtimony of the preſent <hi>Church,</hi> that that which they believe is the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if all the maine and ſubſtantiall points of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith muſt be believed, before we can ſecurely read and truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> than they are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105178:49"/> believed not upon <hi>Scripture,</hi> but upon <hi>Tradition</hi> going before <hi>Scripture;</hi> and that it is ſo is manifeſt, becauſe true faith is not built, but upon Scripture truly underſtood according to the right ſenſe thereof, nor can we underſtand the <hi>Scripture</hi> aright, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we firſt know the main Articles of Faith, which all are bound expreſly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, by which as by a rule, we muſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our ſelves in the interpretation of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> otherwiſe without being ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the rule of faith by <hi>Tradition,</hi> men are apt to fall into grievous errors, even againſt the main articles of the faith, as of the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God, as experience doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifie; ſo that reading and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting <hi>Scripture,</hi> doth not make men <hi>Christians,</hi> but ſuppoſeth them to be made ſo by <hi>Tradition;</hi> at leaſt for the main points, ſuch as every one is bound expreſly to know.</p>
               <p>Fourthly they to whom the <hi>Apostles</hi> wrote and delivered the <hi>Scripture,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready converted to <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in all neceſſary points of faith, and in the common practiſes of <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and ſo, by what they knew by <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> could eaſily interpret what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105178:50"/> but otherwiſe might eaſily have failed in the maineſt points, as ſome forſaking <hi>Tradition</hi> did; for example the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who were confuted by the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> not by bare <hi>Scripture,</hi> for of that the <hi>Arrians</hi> had plenty, but as it was interpreted by <hi>Tradition;</hi> Therefore none can be ſuppoſed to underſtand the Scripture aright, &amp; ſo to know the true word and will of God, but by being ſuch as they were, to whom the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> delivered the Scripture; that is, firſt inſtructed by Tradition: Otherwiſe they may eaſily erre in ſome chiefe articles of Faith, any of which to erre in, is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And I would faine know, whether any underſtanding <hi>Proteſtant</hi> doth believe, that if a <hi>Bible</hi> were given to a <hi>heathen,</hi> or to one borne amongſt themſelves (ſuppoſing he had not been trained up by <hi>Catechiſme</hi> and other traditionall inſtruction) whether I ſay he could out of that extract, as points cleerly expreſſed therein, the thirty nine Articles of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or the book called the <hi>Harmony of Confeſſions,</hi> which is the profeſſion of the faith of moſt of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the world?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we cannot with modeſty ſay, that we are more able to underſtand <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> than were our fore-fathers, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

Moreover the <hi>Apostle</hi> in that place ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth only of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the Old <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> for the New was not written in the infancy of <hi>Timothy,</hi> nor ſome of it at this very time that theſe words were written; and theſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> he affirmes alſo to inſtruct <hi>Timothy,</hi> not by themſelves alone, but <hi>by faith, which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is, joyned with the doctrine of the Chriſtian faith, which <hi>Timothy</hi> had heard,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105178:51"/> and believed on the voice of <hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the following words of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> are with equall confidence inſiſted on, <hi>All Scripture inſpired of God is profitable to teach, &amp;c.</hi> is very unprofitable for their purpoſe, ſeeing that <hi>profitable</hi> can by no means be ſtretcht to ſignifie <hi>ſufficient,</hi> as they would have it, and that for every man, but particularly for him that is HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MO DEI, <hi>a man of God,</hi> that is, one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inſtructed by <hi>Tradition,</hi> in all the main points of Chriſtian faith and godly life, ſuch an one as <hi>Timothy</hi> was. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Scriptures</hi> may be granted ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, joyned with <hi>Tradition,</hi> but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.

Secondly, the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf ſends us to ſupply her wants, not to the rules of Logick, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Hold the Traditions which ye have received by word or our Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.15. It ſendeth us to the Church, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. <hi>which whoſoever doth not heare, is as a Heathen and a Publican,</hi> Matth. 18.17. It did the ſame to the Jewes, who had the Scriptures alſo, ſaying, <hi>Remember the old dayes, think upon every generation: ask thy father and he will declare unto thee, the elders and they will tell thee,</hi> Deut. 32.7.

               <p n="5">§ 5. And whereas it is further objected, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> diſputed negatively from the Scripture, againſt Heretiques, thus; <hi>Doctrine is not cleerly delivered in Scripture,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105178:52"/> therefore it is not to be received as a matter of Faith;</hi> we muſt know that the <hi>Fathers</hi> proceeded upon this ſuppoſition that was known to all, and granted by the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi> themſelves, namely that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines they diſputed againſt, were not the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> and in this caſe they required the teſtimony of Scripture. Yea more, the <hi>Fathers</hi> did not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire places of Scripture from the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> by way of deduction and Logicall inference (for to ſuch all ancient <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> now pretend, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they delude ignorant people) but they required of them to ſhew their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in Scripture, ſaith <hi>Irenaeus, expreſly</hi> and <hi>in termes;</hi> and to prove it, not by texts<note n="*" place="margin">Aug. de unitat.

                  </note> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſharpneſſe of wit in the Auditors to judge, who doth more probably interpret them, not by places which require an interpreter, one to make Logicall inferences upon the text, but by places plaine, manifeſt, cleere, which leave no place to contrary expoſition, and that no Sophiſtry can wreſt them to other ſenſe; to the end that controverſies which concern the ſalvation of ſoules, be defined by Gods formall Word, and not by dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105178:53"/> from it by rules of Logicke. And even by this way of the <hi>Fathers</hi> arguing negatively from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion</hi> is quite overthrowne; for ſeeing nothing is to be reputed a matter of faith, which is not formally and expreſly to be proved by the Word of God, either written, or unwritten, and delivered by full <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Tradition;</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe not, nor can pretend to this <hi>Tradition,</hi> nor yet can prove their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets by <hi>Scripture</hi> in expreſſe and evident termes, but ſuch as themſelves confeſſe to receive probable ſolutions, it muſt hence neceſſarily follow that their doctrines are falſe, without foundation, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by every <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Laſtly whereas <hi>Proteſtants</hi> object that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are reproved by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the obſervation of <hi>Traditions,</hi> it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent; for the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not ſay that their Traditions were derived by ſucceſſion from <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt deliverer of their law, nor did the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> pretend to it, but they were Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their owne, whereof ſome were fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and ſuperſtitious, ſome impious, ſome pious,: The frivolous and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious were their waſhing of hands, pots,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105178:53"/> diſhes, &amp; the like, ſuppoſing that otherwiſe they might have ſome ſpirituall impurity in them; which our <hi>Saviour</hi> confutes ſaying, <hi>There is nothing without a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into him which can defile him. Mark</hi> 7.15. The impious were ſuch, as whereby they violated the commandements of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of obſerving their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as when they allowed a man under pretence of giving ſomething to the <hi>Church</hi> to neglect his duty to his parents; <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.11. Neither of theſe kinds is the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church</hi> guilty of. Of their pious, we have an example in their paying Tithes of mint, a very ſmall herb, which was a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their owne not commanded in their law, yet this our <hi>Saviour</hi> approves and binds them to it, ſaying, <hi>this you ought to have done, Luc.</hi> 11.42. And it is worth the obſervation, that the thing moſt of all objected againſt our <hi>Saviour,</hi> was the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word and Tradition of God by <hi>Moſes</hi> about keeping the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in all the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi>) from which precept, not by Tradition unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but by logicall inferences of their owne, they concluded that our <hi>Saviour</hi> brake the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by healing or doing

So that the <hi>Phariſaicall Traditions</hi> were not pretended to be doctrines unwritten, derived from the firſt deliverer of their religion, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines concluded from the Scripture, by the rules of Logick and reaſon (as they conceived) according to the preſent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Protestants.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the <hi>Church is infallible</hi> in whatſoever ſhe propoſeth, as the Word of God <hi>written</hi> or <hi>unwritten,</hi> whether of great or ſmall conſequence. That to doubt of any one point, is to deſtroy the foundation of faith. And that Proteſtants diſtinction between points <hi>fundamentall</hi> and <hi>non-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi> is ridiculous and deceiptfull.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. HAving thus found out that the <hi>Church</hi> was ſhee, from whom I was to receive aſſurance what is the word of God; and that otherwiſe it was impoſſible for me to know it, and that ſhee could not miſtake nor erre in her directions, I conceived then, that I was bound to believe all that ſhee propounded to me as the word of God, whether it were written or not written (writing being no
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105178:54"/> teſtimony of the truth of any thing, ſeeing it may be falſe as well as ſpeaking) and that to doubt of any thing, was to call all into queſtion, and to diſſolve the whole nature of divine faith. For to believe hath a threefold ſignification in ſpeech; firſt it is taken for knowledge; as where our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thomas becauſe thou haſt ſeen me thou believeſt, John</hi> 20.29. to wit, that I am riſen: now he that ſees one, knowes ſo much. Secondly, for opinion; which is an aſſent begot by probable reaſon, ſo men delivering their opinions, uſe to ſay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thus, or thus. Thirdly and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, for an aſſent unto ſuch things as doe not appear, but are aſſented unto by a firm reliance on the truth of him that reports them, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Faith is the argument of things not ſeen, Heb,</hi> 11.1.</p>
               <p>And this reliance on an Author, ſuch as cannot deceive or be deceived (at leaſt in thoſe things which he propounds unto us to be believed) muſt beget in us an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall belief of things that have humane poſſibility or probability on their ſide, and of things that are clean againſt it; the matter propounded makes no matter, nor yet the manner of propounding; it is the <hi>Author,</hi> and our apprehenſion of him
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105178:55"/> that controles all oppoſition. By this do we believe the inexplicable myſtery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of God, the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hood</hi> and yet <hi>Virginity</hi> of the B. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mother,</hi> with many others, with as much eaſe, as we believe that <hi>Noah</hi> had three ſons, or that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had neither ſilver nor gold: and by this do we believe the latter with as much ſtrength and firmneſſe as the former. For he that believes a thing becauſe ſuch an one ſayes it, who he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves cannot lie, muſt believe all that he ſayes, and that with the ſame firmneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reaſon of his belief ſtill remaines, namely, the inerrability of the ſpeaker. But if he apply his belief according to the probability of the thing ſpoken, and no further, then he doth not believe, becauſe of the truth of the ſpeaker, but of the thing ſpoken, which he muſt gather from probabilities of reaſon, wherein he doth not believe the thing for the truth ſake of the ſpeakers teſtimony, but for the likelihood thereof, which he finds by the meaſure of his own underſtanding; which is not to believe the other, but himſelfe; and the other no more than he would do the arranteſt lyer in the world, yea the Devill himſelf, that is, ſo far as he by his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105178:55"/> reaſon conceives that he ſpeakes the truth. Which reaſon of his, if it be infallible, he doth not believe the thing properly, but he knowes it; if it be but probable, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it not properly, but hath an opinion of it; and no more aſſurance than of other humane reports, whoſe authors have no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from error; which as they may be true, ſo they may alſo be falſe. And thus to believe, is not to believe by divine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible faith, but by humane and fallible; and ſo it cancells divine ſupernaturall faith, the firſt in order of the three theologicall vertues, without which no man can be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. So that all the place that reaſon hath in the government of our faith is this, to lead us to believe that teſtimony which cannot deceive us, and for the particular objects of beliefe, to take them upon truſt of that teſtimony, without checking at them whatſoever they be; and though they be bones to Philoſophy, yet make them milke to faith; and not as <hi>Heretiques</hi> doe, make us demand a reaſon of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular point of faith, which if it ſquare not to their apprehenſions, they caſhiere: This is not faith, but fancy. For, to rely upon a humane baſis ſuch as reaſon is,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105178:56"/> will not ſupport ſuch a mighty ſtatue as divine faith: And, to uſe <hi>Chillingworths</hi> own ſimilitude, <hi>Water will not riſe higher then the fountain from whence it ſprings:</hi> if therefore particular reaſon be the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of our faith, which reaſon is a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and fallible thing, it cannot riſe to, nor ſupport a divine faith: But divine faith is that which God requires of us in the buſineſſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> and that which is not ſuch, is none. And it is convenient, that as God ordained man to a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall end, namely the bliſſefull viſion of himſelfe, which is a thing far above all excellencies of nature; ſo he ſhould bring him to this bliſſe, by believing things above the reach of reaſon, which in man is his nature; and to beget this faith by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, his owne acts, which are above the power of nature; and by the teſtimony of thoſe that do thoſe ſupernaturall acts; to whom, if he have given his deeds, it cannot be doubted but he hath given his word, of any part whereof to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doubt, is to call the credit of all into queſtion; the houſe of Faith being like ſome artificiall buildings, whereof if you pull out one pin, you looſen the whole frame: So if a man disbelieve any one
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105178:56"/> point delivered him by the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> he unjoynts the whole frame of faith, and virtually denies it all; and that becauſe they have all the ſame height of proof, to wit, the teſtimony of the <hi>Church;</hi> which if ſhe can lie in one thing, ſhe may (for ought wee know) in another, and ſo in all, and thus bring a man to doubt of all, and then to denie all: And that thoſe men that doe denie ſome one point of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Tradition</hi> (though unwritten) doe not denie all, is not for that they have any faith, but out of ſecular ends, and deceiptfull reaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Indeed ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> grant that if <hi>Tradition</hi> be univerſall, and perfectly <hi>Catholique,</hi> it doth oblige to the belief thereof, but not otherwiſe; by which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall <hi>Tradition</hi> they meane, ſuch as never any one gainſaid. But if ſuch onely are to be called <hi>Catholique Traditions,</hi> there is ſcarce any thing left for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, (and indeed to that paſſe have many brought it;) for ſome have denied the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Perſons in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> others the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> others his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi> others the <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and a hundred more: now if no <hi>Tradition</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:105178:57"/> be to be called <hi>Catholique,</hi> but ſuch as was never denied by any one, or ſome number of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> then a man may deny the fore-mentioned, and many other points and Articles of faith, becauſe their <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> hath not been ſo univerſall, but that ſome have denied it; yea ſome books of the Scripture it ſelf were not univerſally received, till about four hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Catholique</hi> or <hi>univerſall Tradition</hi> then muſt be underſtood, that which the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> hath alwaies taught, not which all <hi>Christians,</hi> for then we muſt look for <hi>Tradition</hi> in the mouths of Heretiques, whoſe property it is to deny ſome <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or other, under pretence that it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to <hi>Scripture.</hi> And if any have taught contrary, the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them for <hi>Heretiques,</hi> which is a ſufficient proof that untill ſuch Hereticall Spirits oppoſed ſome one or more <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> they were univerſally believed. As for example, the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſts conſubſtantiality,</hi> or being of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, no reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man will deny, but that it was generally believed in the <hi>Church,</hi> before the daies of the <hi>Arch-heretique Arrius,</hi> and that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105178:57"/> the <hi>Councel of Nice</hi> condemning of him, was a ſufficient proof that the doctrine he oppoſed was the <hi>univerſall Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> by force whereof he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and not by <hi>Scripture</hi> only, there being no place of <hi>Scripture</hi> ſo plaine, but he would give ſome anſwer to it, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alledge plenty of <hi>Scripture</hi> in the proof of his own <hi>Hereſie,</hi> while he took upon him to interpret it himſelf, (forfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the traditionall ſenſe thereof) and would receive no anſwer to it. And if <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his denyall of that point of <hi>Faith,</hi> will make it univerſall for place, or the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it ſelf new, and ſo univerſall for time; (as ſome in other inſtances do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) becauſe it was then firſt declared by reaſon of that oppoſition, then it may be lawfull under the ſame pretence for men to deny all the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> all the decrees of <hi>Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to revive all the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies</hi> that were in the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Moreover to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute conditionall infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility to the <hi>Church,</hi> and not abſolute in all that ſhe delivers (<note n="*" place="margin">Chillingworth pag. <hi>118.</hi> Pet.

And if ſhe ſay, ſhe have expounded Scripture tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and decided controverſies aright, by the rule of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> who ſhall gaineſay her? Can any man be ſo fooliſh as to think his word is of more credit than the whole <hi>Churches?</hi> Or that his reaſon is better then hers? Or that if ſhe may erre from her rule, he may not do ſo alſo? And if their infallibilities be both of the ſame ſtrength, who in his right mind would not believe millions affirming the ſame thing, rather than one, or ſome few affirming the contrary? If there were a rule ſo plaine and clear that all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Frivolous then and without foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is that late ſtarted diſtinction of points fundamentall and not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and the aſſertion built thereon; That the <hi>Church</hi> may erre in the one and not in the other; and ſo by conſequence we are not bound to believe her in all things. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in regard of the materiall object or thing to be believed, ſome points are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, others not; that is, ſome points are to be believed explicitely and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105178:59"/> others not: and more points are to bee believed explicitely, by ſome than by others, as I have ſhewed before, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of points neceſſary to ſalvation. But in regard of the formall object and motive for which we believe, namely, the truth of God revealing it by his <hi>Church,</hi> there is no diſtinction of points of faith, we being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually bound to believe all that is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently propoſed unto us, as revealed by God, whether the matter be great or ſmall: and whether the points be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall in their matter or no, yet they are propoſed unto us by the ſame authority; therefore we are bound equally, with the ſame firmeneſſe of faith, to believe every one as any one. For example, the <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> containes divers fundamentall points, as the <hi>Diety, Trinity</hi> of <hi>Perſons, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> it containes alſo ſome points for their matter and nature in themſelves not fundamentall, as under what judge he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that he was buried, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time when he roſe againe, to wit, the third day; Now whoſoever knowes theſe to be contained in the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> is bound to believe them as firmely as the other, and the denyall of any one of them,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105178:59"/> is a fundamentall and damnable errour, a giving of God the lie. For the nature of faith doth not ariſe from the greatneſſe or ſmalneſſe of the thing believed, for then there ſhould be as many different faiths, as there are points to be believed, but from the motive for which a man believes, which is Gods revelation teſtified by the <hi>Church,</hi> which being alike for all objects, it is manifeſt, that they that in things equally revealed by God, do grant one thing and deny another, do forſake the very formall motive of faith, Gods revelation, and ſo have no true divine faith at all.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Moreover if the <hi>Churches infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> be tied to a certain matter in <hi>Religion,</hi> then it is meet we ſhould know that firſt, that ſo we may accordingly apply our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, if it be fundamentall, then without doubt to imbrace it, if not, to exerciſe our liberty, and believe it ſo far as we ſee cauſe; but then we muſt know the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe is infallible, diſtinctly and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as alſo infallibly, or elſe we may miſtake, and believe, when we need not, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe when we ought not. Now from whence ſhall we have this knowledge? God hath no where revealed it; and it ought to have been revealed together with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105178:60"/> the Commiſſion given to the <hi>Church</hi> to teach, or elſe ſhee might have deceived us before the caution came; but the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelfe hath told us no ſuch matter; we have no ſuch <hi>Tradition;</hi> therefore we muſt have this moſt fundamentall point of all the reſt, which is, to know what is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and what not, either by inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by the ſtrength of reaſon, both which are ridiculous; or by ſome autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity coequall to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and yet not hers, which is moſt abſurd. And in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſeemed unto me, to deal as obſcurely and deceiptfully, as did once <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who in a return to peace betwixt him and his ſubjects, granted pardon to all, except fifteen, but would not declare what their names were; but if at any time he had a mind, out of ſome new diſpleaſure, to cut off any man, he would ſay, he was one of the fifteen, whom he excepted from the benefit of his pardon: In like manner the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, we will believe the <hi>Church</hi> in all points, but thoſe that are not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, not expreſſing what they are; and when they have a wanton diſpoſition to deny their belief to ſomething that the <hi>Church</hi> hath declared, they ſhelter their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105178:60"/> denyall under the protection of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited diſtinction, and ſay, it is a point not fundamentall. And if on the other ſide they find it for their advantage to cloſe with other <hi>Churches,</hi> they ſay, they are all one <hi>Church</hi> with them, becauſe forſooth they agree, in they know not what, that is, in their inexplicable fundamentalls.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. But <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath undertaken to give us, though not a catalogue, yet a deſcription, (as he ſuppoſes) by which we may diſcern between fundamentalls, &amp; not fundamentalls, or circumſtantialls, as he calls them.<note place="margin">

The later ſuch, as though God hath revealed them, yet the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> are not bound under paine of damnation, particularly to teach them unto all, and the people may ſecurely be ignorant of them. And this is even the ſame obſcurity in more words; for what is to be preached to all, and believed by all, and what the Paſtors may forbear to preach, and the people may be ignorant of (eſpecially ſeeing the ſame degree of ignorance is not ſecure to all people alike, but receives infinite variety, according to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105178:61"/> their meanes of knowledge) is as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable, as what is fundamentall and what not. But ſuppoſe the <hi>Pastors</hi> doe preach more than they are bound to preach and reveal that truth, which if it had not been revealed, the people might ſafely have been ignorant of, may they be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or unbelieving now it is revealed to them? If they be, then they deny that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry authority upon which they believed the moſt fundamentall points, which is the ground of all belief, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence deny the whole faith: From whence wee may ſee, that the <hi>Paſtors</hi> teaching is not to be ſtinted by the things the people ought neceſſarily to believe; but the peoples neceſſity of believing ought to be enlarged according to the meaſure of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> preaching. The <hi>Church</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the teaching of fundamentalls on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the matter, but whatſoever ſhee teacheth is fundamentall for the forme, and motive of beliefe. The circumſtantialls are (as he confeſſeth) revealed by God to the <hi>Church;</hi> and if the <hi>Church</hi> reveal them to the people, the people muſt either believe them, or deny to believe God. And though common people, and others alſo, may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ignorant, before they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105178:61"/> yet they may not be ſo after; nor hath God confined the <hi>Paſtors</hi> inſtructing of the people to any certain matter, to fundamentalls only; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> teach all nations, to obſerve all things, whatſoever he commanded them. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. And though common people may ſafely be ignorant of many things, yet they muſt not be unbelieving of any thing; but by an implicite faith at the leaſt, believe all that the <hi>Church</hi> believes, by adhering, and reſigning themſelves to her, being prepared to believe explicitly what and when ſhee ſhall declare it to them: Which faith is originally and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally built upon the Word of God, not as written, but as delivered by the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſucceſſively from the <hi>Apostles;</hi> upon the authority whereof, we believe that both Scriptures and all other Articles of faith were delivered to them by the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by God, the fountain of all truth.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That there is and ever ſhall be a <hi>viſible Church</hi> upon earth; And that this Church is one, holy, Catholique and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. NOw conſidering all that hath been ſaid before, the ſumme whereof is this; That we have no meanes to know certainly the doctrines of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;</hi> but only the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and that that <hi>Tradition</hi> is, and ought to be infallible; hence I conceived, that this conſequence was neceſſary, that there ſhould be, and is alwaies, a viſible <hi>Church</hi> in the world, to whoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> men might cleave; and that this <hi>Church</hi> is one, univerſall, <hi>Apostolicall, Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt there is alwaies a true <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the world; for if there be no meanes for men to know that Scriptures, and all other Articles came from <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſo conſequently from God, but the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> then there muſt needs be in all ages a <hi>Church,</hi> receiving and delivering theſe <hi>Traditions,</hi> elſe men in ſome age ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould have been deſtitute of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105178:62"/> ordinary meanes of ſalvation, becauſe they had no meanes to know aſſuredly the doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> without aſſured faith whereof, no man can be ſaved. And although a falſe <hi>Church</hi> may deliver the true Word of God, as it is contained in the <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Creed,</hi> yea even a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Heathen</hi> may do ſo, for this is but caſuall; yet none but a true <hi>Church</hi> can deliver the Word of God, with aſſurance to the receiver that the text is incorrupt, thereby binding him to the belief thereof; Now it is neceſſary that men have the true <hi>Scripture,</hi> not only caſually, but they muſt be ſure the Text thereof be uncorrupt; therefore there muſt be a true unerring <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe authority is ſo aut hentique, that it is a ſufficient warrant for men to believe the doctrine ſhee delivers, to come from the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this <hi>Church</hi> muſt be alwaies viſible, and conſpicuous; For the <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> muſt ever be famous, and moſt notoriouſly known in the world, that a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> may truly ſay with S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De utilit Cred. c. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the conſent of Nations, and Countries, and moſt celebrious fame.</hi> Now if the <hi>Church</hi> were at any time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105178:63"/> or very ſecret and hidden, then could not her Traditions be famouſly known, nor could men that were willing to ſubmit themſelves to her directions, know where to find her, out of whoſe communion they cannot attain ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> that is, derived from the <hi>Apoſtolicall Sea,</hi> by the ſucceſſion of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Paſtors;</hi> for elſe how can we be aſſured that we have the <hi>Apoſtles doctrine?</hi> It muſt be one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that muſt certifie another; and if there ſhould be any interruption, in that time, all might be loſt and changed. And how could the <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine</hi> be notoriouſly <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> if the <hi>Church,</hi> delivering the ſame, hath not a manifeſt and conſpicuous pedigree and derivation from the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> Which is a convincing argument uſed by S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>48.</hi> circa med.</note> 
                  <hi>How doe we truſt out of the divine writings, that we have manifeſtly received Chriſt, if we have not alſo from thence mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly received his Church?</hi> The <hi>Church that</hi> hath a lineall ſucceſſion of <hi>Biſhops</hi> from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> famous and illuſtrious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not one hath been oppoſite in <hi>Religion</hi> to his immediate predeceſſor, proves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105178:63"/> that this <hi>Church</hi> hath the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For as in the rank of three hundred ſtones ranged in order, if no two ſtones be found in that line of different colour, then if the firſt be white, the ſecond is white, and ſo the reſt unto the laſt; even ſo if there be a ſucceſſion of three hundred <hi>Biſhops</hi> all of the ſame <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> if the firſt have the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the ſecond hath, and ſo the reſt even unto the laſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>one,</hi> that is, all the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> deliver, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all her <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>children</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one and the ſame Faith. For if the Preachers and Paſtors of the <hi>Church</hi> diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree about matters which they preach as neceſſary points of Faith, they loſe all their credit and authority; for who will believe witneſſes on their own words, if they diſagree in their teſtimony?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I infer, that this <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall,</hi> ſpread over all Nations, that ſhe may be ſaid to be every where, morally ſpeaking (that is, according to common humane account, by which a thing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed over a great part of the world, and famouſly knowne, is ſaid to be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; In this manner, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:105178:64"/> ſaid, that the faith of the <hi>Romans, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the whole world.) Rom.</hi> 1.12. that ſo the whole world may take notice of her, as of a worthy and credible wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Chriſtian Tradition,</hi> howſoever her outward glory and ſplendour, peace and tranquillity, in ſome places and at ſome times be more or leſſe eclipſed, and ſhee be not alwaies in all places at once. And the reaſon of this perpetuall viſible univerſality is, becauſe the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is the ſole ordinary meanes of faith toward the Word of God. This <hi>Tradition</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be ſo delivered, as that it may be known to all men, ſeeing God will have all men (without exception of any nation) <hi>to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. which they cannot do, unleſſe the <hi>Church</hi> be ſo diffuſed in the world, that all known nations may take notice of her. And Gods will that all men ſhould be ſaved, though it be but an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent will, as Schoolemen call it, yet it inferreth two things, which ſome <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> deny; firſt the ſalvation of all men; ſecondly the meanes of their ſalvation. In reſpect of the meanes, the will of God is abſolute, that all men in ſome ſort or other have ſufficient meanes of ſalvation. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105178:64"/> of the end, to wit, the ſalvation of all men, the will of God is not abſolute, but as Schoolemen ſay, virtually conditionall; that is, God hath a will that all men be ſaved, as much as lies in him, if the courſe of his providence be not intercepted, and men will cooperate with his grace. And the reaſon why ſome Nations hear not the <hi>Goſpell</hi> and Word of God, is not the defect of his <hi>Church,</hi> but the want of working in the naturall cauſes, to diſcover ſuch Countries; which defect God will not ever miraculouſly ſupply. But if the <hi>Church</hi> were inviſible to the world, and hoarded up her <hi>Religion</hi> to her ſelfe, either not daring, or not willing to profeſſe and preach the ſame unto others; Nations may be knowne, and yet the Word of God not known to them. If therefore this <hi>Church</hi> ſhould be hidden for a long time, mens ſouls ſhould periſh, not through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the naturall cauſes, but only through the hiddenneſſe, obſcurity, and wretchedneſſe of the ſupernaturall meanes, to wit, of the <hi>Church;</hi> not endewed with ſo much zeal and courage, as to profeſſe her <hi>Religion,</hi> and to propagate it in the world, which cannot be; Therefore it is impoſſible that the true Church ſhould
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105178:65"/> not be ever univerſall, and famouſly known.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, this <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>holy,</hi> both in life and Doctrine. <hi>Holy</hi> for life, ſhining in all admirable ſanctity, the rayes whereof do overcome the hearts of the beholders; ſuch as the <hi>Holy Apoſtles</hi> gave example of, as of poverty, chaſtitie, obedience, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in undergoing all forms of labour, and danger for the ſafety of ſoules; patience invincible in the rough handling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by wonderfull faſtings, and all kind of auſterities; fortitude heroicall in ſuffering martyrdome, not onely with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but with joy, though given them in all the moſt hideous ſhapes, that mans imagination ſteeled with malice, could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. And although this kind of ſanctity does not ſhine in all the members of the <hi>Church,</hi> but in the more eminent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and principally in the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> yet if this kind of ſanctity together with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were wanting, ſhe could not be ſo ſufficient a witneſſe to <hi>Infidells,</hi> who ordinarily are not won to the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and admiration of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but by beholding ſuch wonders of power, and ſanctity in the Profeſſors thereof. Holy ſhee is alſo for doctrine, in regard
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105178:65"/> her traditions are divine and holy, without commixture of error; for if the <hi>Church</hi> could deliver any one, or few errors, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with many truths, her <hi>Traditions</hi> even of the truth were queſtionable, and could not be believed upon her word: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as if we admit in <hi>Scripture,</hi> any error in ſmaller matters, we cannot be ſure of its infallibility in matters of greateſt moment; as he that ſhall ſay, Gods written word is falſe, or uncertaine, when it tells him, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> left his cloake at <hi>Troas,</hi> may alſo ſay with as much reaſon, that it is falſe or uncertain, when it tells him that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was borne of the <hi>Virgin Mary:</hi> Even ſo he that grants that ſome part of <hi>Traditions</hi> or the Word of God unwritten, may be falſe, inferrs by conſequence, that every part thereof may be ſo; and that becauſe we have no antecedent ground or touch-ſtone to try <hi>Traditions</hi> by, but they muſt be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for their own ſakes, being therein more fundamentall than the <hi>Scripures,</hi> which are not known to be <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> but by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> whereas perpetuall <hi>Tradition</hi> is knowne to come from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by its own light; for what can be more evident, then that that is from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which is delivered as <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:105178:66"/> by perpetuall ſucceſſion of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and people, affirming and believing the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. But againſt this truth, that if the <hi>Church</hi> may erre in one thing, neither wee, nor ſhee can be ſure that ſhee ſpeakes truth in any thing, <hi>Chillingworth</hi> makes theſe (in my judgement) impertinent interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>A Judge may poſſibly erre in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can he therefore never have aſſurance that he hath judged right? A travayler may poſſibly mistake his way, muſt I therefore be doubtfull whether I am in the right way from my hall to my chamber?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 117. <hi>ſect.</hi> 106.</note> In which he weakly falls into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betwixt matters which are the object of the ſenſe, or of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and of faith; which in this caſe have no proportion betwixt them. For the doctrines of faith, (as they are of faith, being altogether, and all equally, without the reach of our knowledge) we have no way to attaine to, but by the help of others, whom we muſt abſolutely believe; and if we know that they may deliver that which is falſe to us, wee can never be ſure that any thing they deliver to us, is not falſe, unleſſe we had ſome ſuperiour rule to try and examine their <hi>Traditions</hi> by, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we have not. Nor can the <hi>Church</hi> it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105178:66"/> ſelfe, if ſhee may erre in the delivery of one thing, be ſure that ſhee doth not erre in every thing, becauſe ſhee hath no infallible rule to examine her doctrines by, out of her ſelfe; who if ſhee be aſſiſted by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> cannot erre in any thing, if not, for ought ſhee knowes, ſhee doth in all things. Now that the <hi>Church</hi> is aſſiſted by God, and that mans reaſon cannot be the higheſt judge, to whom the laſt appeal is made in matters of faith, which deſcend from God, I have ſhewed before. As for a humane Judge, as he may erre through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, wilfulneſſe, or negligence, which to conceive of the <hi>Church,</hi> is abſurd, yea blaſphemous, ſhee having <hi>Chriſt</hi> for her Head, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> for her <hi>Spirit;</hi> ſo he cannot bee more certaine of the truth of his judgement, than his reaſon can make him, which will not reach to an abſolute infallibility. And as a travayler may miſtake his way in one journey, ſo he may in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he have no more certainty nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter guide of the one way, than of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is the <hi>Churches</hi> caſe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding and believing matters of faith, revealed to her by God, which, like the Circumference from the Center, are all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſtant from our knowledge, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105178:67"/> the <hi>Church</hi> hath an equall Prerogative of infallibility by the guidance of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in all, who therefore can erre in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or in all things, which ſhe ſaith ſhe ſo receives, and delivers. Yet <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> ſaith, that his conſequences are as like the other, as an egge to an egge, or milk to milk; but more truly, they are as like as an egge to an oyſter, or milk to ink.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. And leſt any <hi>Protestant,</hi> who honours the <hi>Scriptures</hi> much with his lips, though he be far removed with his heart, ſhould think that I am injurious to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> in ſaying that <hi>Tradition</hi> is more fundamentall, than <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelfe, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to take notice, that <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> according to different compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are equall and ſuperior the one to the other. Compare them in reſpect of certainty of truth, they are equall, both being the Word of God, the one written, the other unwritten, and ſo both infinitely certain.

               <p>THeſe premiſes conſidered, I look'd round about to ſee amongſt al the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of the world profeſſing the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to which of them the title and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Church,</hi> might moſt juſtly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105178:68"/> be applyed; and I found that the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that is the multitude of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſpred over the face of the known world, adhering to the doctrine of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> is the <hi>One, Holy, Catholique</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique Church.</hi> The vulgar objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the title of <hi>Catholique Roman,</hi> that is, ſay they, univerſall, and yet but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſeemed very childiſh; the one title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applyed in regard of the doctrine, and the extent thereof, which is univerſall; the other of the diſcipline, and the fountaine, and head thereof, which is particular, from the <hi>Biſhop of Rome.</hi> For the word <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> is taken three waies, to wit, <hi>formally, cauſally,</hi> and <hi>participatively. Formally,</hi> the univerſall <hi>Church</hi> only, that is to ſay, the ſociety of all the true particular <hi>Churches,</hi> united in one ſelfeſame <hi>Communion,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Catholique.

               </p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Now I was induced to believe, that the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is the only true <hi>Catholike Church;</hi> by theſe enſuing reaſons. Firſt God being the <hi>Prime Verity,</hi> revealing truth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer the knowledg of ſaving doctrine to be impoſſible, but it is impoſſible, if it be hidden; or if a falſe meanes of knowledge
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105178:69"/> thereof, be ſo dreſt with the marks of the true, as that the true become undiſcernable from it: And if the <hi>Roman</hi> be not the true <hi>Catholique Church</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> then the true Catholique Church and <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is hidden, and a falſe <hi>Church</hi> hath the marks of the true ſo cleerly, that no other can with any colour pretend to be <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> rather than it; that is, to have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by whole worlds of <hi>Chriſtian Fathers,</hi> to whole worlds of <hi>Chriſtian children.</hi> Hence either there is no meanes left aſſuredly to know the ſaving truth, or elſe it muſt be inward teaching by immediate revelation, without any externall infallible meanes; or the <hi>Scripture,</hi> known to be the Word of God, and truly interpreted, by the light and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the things, or by the force of naturall reaſon, the vanity and falſhood whereof I have already ſhewed: for knowledge of ſupernaturall truth, by the light and luſtre of the doctrine, is proper to the <hi>Church triumphant,</hi> inward aſſurance without an externall infallible ground is proper unto <hi>Prophets</hi> and the firſt publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Religion.</hi> Hence it may be concluded, that if God be the <hi>Prime Verity,</hi> teaching <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> darkely, without making
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105178:69"/> men ſee the light of things believed; and mediatly, by ſome externall infallible meanes, upon which inward aſſurance muſt rely, then he muſt ever conſerve the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> viſible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, that the ſame may be by ſenſible marks diſcerned.</p>
               <p>And if any object, that the ſenſes of men in this ſearch may be deceived, through na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall invincible fallibility of their organs, and ſo be no ground of faith, that is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether infallible; I anſwer, that evidence had by ſenſe, being but the private ſenſe of one man, is not ordinarily fallible; but when the ſame is alſo publique &amp; generall, that is, when a whole world of men concur with him, then his evidence is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Beſides, ſeeing God will not teach men immediatly, but will have them cleave to an externall infallible means, and to find out this means by the ſenſible evidence of the thing, he is in a manner bound by the perfection of his veracity to aſſiſt mens ſenſes with his providence, that therein they be not deceived, when they uſe ſuch diligence, as men ordinarily uſe, that they be not deceived by their ſenſes. Now what greater evidence can one have, that he is not deceived in this matter of ſenſe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105178:70"/> that the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine is the <hi>Catholique,</hi> that is, doctrine delivered from the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> by worlds of <hi>Christian Ancestors,</hi> unanimous amongſt themſelves in all matters of faith: what greater aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (I ſay) can one have, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſees aright, than a whole world of men profeſſing to ſee the ſame that he doth? And ſurely this was the meaning of God by the <hi>Prophet Eſay,</hi> when ſpeaking of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> he calls it <hi>a direct way, ſo that fools cannot erre therein, Eſa.</hi> 35.8. which cannot be, but by following a world of Anceſtors going before them in the ſame Tract. Otherwiſe it is not only poſſible for fools, but even for them that ſeem to be wiſeſt to erre, yea in this caſe it is impoſſible to be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And if it be further objected, that <hi>I believe the Catholique Church,</hi> is an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, and <hi>Faith is the argument of things not ſeen.</hi> I anſwer, an Article of Faith may be viſible according to the ſubſtance of the thing, and yet inviſible according to the manner it is believed in the <hi>Creed.</hi> The third Article, <hi>He ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried,</hi> according to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the thing, was evident to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105178:70"/> ſenſe, and ſeen of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of their poſterity; but according to the manner that it is believed in the <hi>Creed,</hi> to wit, that herein the Word of God by his <hi>Prophets</hi> was fulfilled, and that it was done for the ſalvation of man; in this manner this viſible Article is inviſible, and ſo it is believed in the <hi>Creed.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that there is in the world <hi>a Catholike Church,</hi> and that the <hi>Romane</hi> is this <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, Pagans, Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> (if they ſhut not their eyes againſt the light) do clearly behold; but that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Word of God, concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall amplitude of his <hi>Church,</hi> is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, that this is an effect of Gods va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, to the end that the meanes to learn ſaving truth may not be hidden, this is a thing inviſible; and according to this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> is propoſed in the <hi>Creed.</hi> Secondly, propoſitions of Faith muſt be inviſible according to the <hi>Predicate</hi> or thing believed, but not alwaies according to the <hi>Subject,</hi> or thing whereof we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome other thing. The things the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> believed of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to wit, that he was the Son of God, the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world, were things inviſible; but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and perſon of whom they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105178:71"/> theſe things, was viſible to them; yea God did of purpoſe by his <hi>Prophets</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell certain tokens, whereby that ſubject might by ſenſe be ſeen and diſcerned from all other, that might pretend the name of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or elſe his comming into the world to teach the truth, had been to little purpoſe. In this ſort <hi>the Predicate</hi> or thing believed in this Article, <hi>the Holy Catholique Church,</hi> to wit, <hi>Holy,</hi> is inviſible, <hi>but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> which we affirme and believe to be holy in her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is viſible and conſpicuous to all. Yea God hath of purpoſe foretold ſignes &amp; tokens, whereby ſhee may by ſenſe be cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned from all other that may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the title of <hi>Catholique.</hi> For, were not this ſubject, the <hi>Holy Catholique Church,</hi> which we believe to be holy and infallible in her teaching, viſible and diſcernable from all other that pretend to that title, of what uſe were it to believe that there is ſuch an infallible teaching <hi>Church</hi> in the world, hidden we know not where, like a Candle under a Buſhell, or a needle in a bottle of hey?</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Secondly, if there muſt be alwaies in the world (as was proved before) <hi>one, holy, Catholique and Apoſtolique Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:105178:71"/> that is, a <hi>Church</hi> delivering doctrines <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly,</hi> thereby making them credible; <hi>univerſally,</hi> thereby making them famouſly known to mankind; <hi>holily,</hi> ſo making them certain, and ſuch, as that on them we may ſecurely rely; <hi>Apoſtolically,</hi> ſo making them flow in the channel of a never-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion of <hi>Biſbops</hi> from the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi> then this <hi>Church</hi> muſt be either the <hi>Roman,</hi> or the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or ſome other oppoſite to both. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot ſay a <hi>Church</hi> oppoſite to both, for then they ſhould be condemned in their own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be bound to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that <hi>Church,</hi> which can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the <hi>Grecian;</hi> a <hi>Church</hi> holding as many doctrines which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> as might eaſily be proved if need were. It is further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> are not this <hi>One, Holy, Catholique and Apoſtolique Church,</hi> ſince their revolt and ſeparation from the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> becauſe in that very act of ſeparation they did extinguiſh all theſe titles; for they changed the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines they once held, they forſook the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whereof they were Members, brake off from the ſtock of that tree whereof they were branches; neither in their departure
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105178:72"/> did they joyne themſelves with any other <hi>Church</hi> different from the <hi>Roman,</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the particular <hi>Protestant</hi> doctrines; ſo that they made a new <hi>Church</hi> of their own not agreeing in all points of faith, with any that went before; neither have they which have come after them (as there are very many <hi>Sects</hi> riſen out of the firſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>) agreed with them. And therefore there is none, or the <hi>Roman</hi> is the <hi>One, Holy Catholique, and Apoſtolique Church.</hi>

               <p n="4">§. 4.

               <p>But ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> object, that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> yet reformed by our <hi>Saviour.</hi> To which may be anſwered that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (out of their deſire to make <hi>Catholiques</hi> ſeem like the <hi>Phariſees</hi>) make themſelves ſeem, as if they did not any whit underſtand the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> For the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall <hi>Traditions,</hi> but certaine practiſes of piety invented by themſelves, and dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by their skill from <hi>Scripture,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would ſeem ſingularly religions, <hi>and not as other men.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>

               <p>Yet notwithſtanding this, the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> doe charge the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> DE FACTO, to have falne into errors, and to have changed her faith; and that becauſe points of doctrine undefined, (about which <hi>Doctors</hi> have diſputed, and held different opinions) have been afterwards defined by the <hi>Church,</hi> ſo that it was not lawfull for any after that, to make doubt thereof; the <hi>Church</hi> by this meanes hath held in later ages, that to be DE FIDE, <hi>a matter of faith,</hi> which the former ages did not, and ſo (ſay they) hath changed the faith, and believes and delivers more than ſhee received from the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But this I found to be no change of faith, but only a declaration of ſome point explicitly, which was implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and involvedly believed before.

               </p>
               <p>For example, in the principles of every Science are contained divers truths, which may be drawn out of them, by many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall concluſions, one following another; Theſe concluſions were truths in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before, though they did not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us, till wee ſaw the connexion they had with the premiſes, and how they were contained in them; And by the many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall concluſions ſo drawn, the truth of thoſe principles doth more ſhew it ſelfe, but doth not receive any change in it ſelfe thereby: even ſo in the prime principles of our faith, revealed immediately by God, and delivered to the <hi>Church,</hi> are contained al truths, that any way belong to our faith; but it was not neceſſary that the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould manifeſt all theſe, at their firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Councell,</hi> but only ſo much in every ſeverall <hi>Councell,</hi> as ſhould concerne the preſent occaſion of their meeting; which is ſome particular <hi>hereſie,</hi> or <hi>hereſies</hi> then ſprung up, and ſo more according to the ſucceſſive growth of <hi>hereſies;</hi> which when ſhee hath done, ſhee cannot be charged with creating of a new faith, or altering of the old; but ſhee doth only, out of old
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:105178:78"/> grounds and premiſes draw ſuch concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as may ſerve to deſtroy new <hi>hereſies,</hi> and ſhew them to be contrary to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent faith. In this manner the <hi>Church</hi> hath grown and increaſed in knowledge by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and ſhall ſtill do ſo to the end of the world. And as the ſun ſpreads the raies of his light more and more betwixt morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and noon, and his beames diſplay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a valley, or ſome roome of a houſe, where they did not before, without any change of light in the ſun himſelfe; So may the <hi>Church</hi> ſpread the light of her faith, ſhewing ſuch or ſuch a point to be a divine truth; which before was not known to be ſo; or which though it were a divine truth in it ſelfe, yet it was not ſo to us, for want of ſufficient propoſall, that is, of the Churches; wherein the <hi>Church</hi> reſembles our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> her <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Spouſe;</hi> who though he never received the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace and knowledge, from the firſt moment of his being conceived, yet the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, <hi>He grew in wiſdome and age, and in favour with God and men, Luc.</hi> 2.52. to wit, becauſe he ſhewed it more and more, in his words and actions.</p>
               <p>This alſo further appeares by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which <hi>Catholique Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:105178:79"/> obſerve in and out of <hi>Councells,</hi> in proving and defining points of faith; namely by having recourſe to the authority of Gods Word, conteined both in <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> and to the belief and practiſe of the <hi>Church;</hi> in ſearching whereof, the <hi>Holy Church</hi> joynes humane induſtry with Gods grace and aſſiſtance. For when any queſtion or doubt of faith ariſeth, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Doctors</hi> ſeverally diſpute and write thereof; then if further cauſe require, the <hi>Holy Church</hi> aſſembles her <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> together in a <hi>generall Councell,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and diſcuſſe the matter more fully, as in that firſt <hi>Councell</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> whereof the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles and Elders aſſembled together, to conſider of this word, Acts</hi> 15.6. The <hi>Paſtors</hi> being thus come together, and having the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> (according to his promiſe) amongſt them, out of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Traditions,</hi> joyning therewith the conſent of holy <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of foregoing times, ſhe doth infallibly reſolve and determine the matter; not as new, but as ancient, ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and derived from her forefathers; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that which was ever in it ſelfe a divine truth, ſo to appeare to us, that now wee
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105178:79"/> may no more make queſtion thereof. So that from hence it appeares, that the <hi>Church</hi> makes no new Articles of faith, ſuch as then may be ſaid to have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but only explications and collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the old, which were delivered to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and by them to us.</p>
               <p>And though the <hi>Church</hi> doe thus grow in the knowledge of points of faith, yet this is no newneſſe of faith, but a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the old, with a kind of increaſe, by way of explicating that which was invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, cleering that which was obſcure, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which was undefined, &amp; obliging men to believe more firmly and explicitly, that which before they were not bound ſo to believe.</p>
               <p>That is only to be called a new faith, which is contrary to that which was held before, or hath no connexion with it; and when we ceaſe to believe that which we believed before; this indeed is change of faith, the other is but encreaſe. And if this encreaſe of faith by the declaration of <hi>Councells,</hi> may be called a change and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of faith, there is no <hi>Heretique</hi> but may challenge antiquity to himſelfe, and put novelty on the ſcore of the <hi>Church.</hi> For he may ſay ſuch a thing, for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105178:80"/> example, that the <hi>Sonne</hi> is of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the <hi>Father,</hi> was not held <hi>de fide, a matter of faith,</hi> before the <hi>Councell of Nice,</hi> therefore it is new. That <hi>Baptiſme</hi> adminiſtred by <hi>Heretiques</hi> is good baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, was not held as a matter of faith before the daies of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> therefore it is new. And the <hi>Heretique</hi> may ſay, that he believes only that which was believed before ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Councell</hi> (which he pleaſe, for the caſe is alike in all) and therefore he believes the antient Faith: By which way of arguing, he may renounce the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of all Councells, as Novelties, and maintaine many Hereſies, as the antient Faith. Yea by this abſurdity a man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny divers Books of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the ſecond Epiſtle of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> of S. <hi>Iude,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> with ſome others, becauſe they were not admitted for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, untill 300. or 400. yeares after they were written. Yet when they were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be Canonicall, there was no change of faith in the <hi>Church</hi> thereby: for the believing of theſe Books was involved in this revealed Article, <hi>I believe in God;</hi> and the believing of them to be Canonicall, was involved in this revealed Article, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105178:80"/> the holy Catholike Church:</hi> onely hereby was an increaſe of the materiall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our faith to us, not in it ſelfe; we being bound upon the declaration of the <hi>Church,</hi> to believe that thing firmely and without diſpute, which before perhaps we were not ſo obliged to doe.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. A fifth argument moving me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> was this: That doctrine which hath been delivered by <hi>Tradition,</hi> as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Anceſtors, without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made by any known <hi>Catholique Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and <hi>Doctors:</hi> and if any did oppoſe the doctrine, he was cenſured of Novelty, and after admonition (if he perſiſted therein) was condemned of Hereſie, ſuch doctrine is derived from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and unchanged, and ſuch is the doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, that divers points of the <hi>Roman doctrine</hi> have been oppoſed, as by <hi>Arrius, Pelagius, Berengarius, Waldo, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe, Huſſe,</hi> and many others, but theſe were not accounted orthodox Fathers, but were taxed of Novelty and innovation, and for ſuch are delivered to us, by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> and hiſtory of the times wherein they lived. And it cannot be prudenty
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105178:81"/> imagined; that if the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> had (like theſe men) attempted to change the doctrine of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> there ſhould be no <hi>Tradition</hi> of it, no hiſtoricall narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, but that all the good and true <hi>Catholiques</hi> ſhould be aſleep, to this great buſineſſe of defending the flock from Wolves; or (which is more abſurd) ſhould againſt their knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſuffer damnable errors to ſteal in, to the deſtruction of themſelves, and all the world that ſhould ſucceed them. Now the oppoſition of the <hi>Church</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned manner, is ſo far from obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Churches</hi> doctrine, that it makes it far more famous, and illuſtrious, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently <hi>Apoſtolicall;</hi> even as the ſun ſtrugling with a miſty morning, breaking through it, appears more beautifully glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unconquerable. And this <hi>Doctor Feild</hi> a learned <hi>Protestant</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>when a doctrine is in any age conſtantly delivered as a matter of faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Field of the Church, l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>14</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from anceſtors, in ſuch ſort as the contradictors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were in the beginning noted for novelty, and if they perſiſted in contradiction, in the end charged with hereſy, it is impoſſible but ſuch a doctrine ſhould come by ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:105178:81"/>
               <p>But <hi>Proteſtants</hi> think it ſufficient, that they find (as they ſay) the <hi>Roman doctrine</hi> contradicted in the writings of orthodox <hi>Fathers,</hi> though their oppoſition was not noted by antiquity, nor by the fame of <hi>Tradition</hi> delivered to poſterity. But this anſwer leaves no meanes to common people to know certainly the perpetuall <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Gods Church,</hi> which is the guide of their faith, but by reading and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which to them is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Beſides if that ſome few obſcure and hard paſſages out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> may ſuffice to call the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> into queſtion, then there is nothing ſo cleerly and unanimouſly delivered by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> but may fall under a new examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſeeing nothing is or can be writ ſo plainely, eſpecially where there is very much alſo written, but that ſome obſcure and oblique paſſages may be raked out, to make ſhew of a contradiction; and if this counterpart may have the title of antiquity ſet over it, what Hereſie will want its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence out of the <hi>Fathers?</hi> What <hi>Tradition</hi> was more conſtantly delivered by the <hi>Chriſtian Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> than our <hi>Saviours Conſubſtantiality</hi> with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Yet the new <hi>Arrians</hi> (as we may
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105178:82"/> ſee in <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) bring divers teſtimonies out of the antient <hi>Fathers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Chriſt. c. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> to prove, that in this point they contradicted themſelves and one another. In like manner, doe the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> now bring ſome obſcure places out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the defence of their hereſies, which yet in a true ſenſe doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no ſuch thing, but being a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, they more eaſily wreſt them to their corrupted meaning. But on the contrary, the <hi>Fathers</hi> are abundant and cleer, in thoſe places which maintaine the <hi>Catholique doctrines,</hi> and none of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of thoſe times did accuſe other of error in thoſe points, which if they had thought them ſo, there is no doubt they would. For wee cannot imagine, the true believers of thoſe times leſſe vigilant than of theſe; and we ſee now, that no man can broach an error againſt faith, but preſently he hath abundant oppoſition, and further queſtioning, if the cauſe require.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is apparent, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> when they alledge the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as contradicting themſelves, and one another in the <hi>Catholique Doctrines</hi> of thoſe times, either miſ-alledge their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105178:82"/> words, or miſtake their meaning. For, if thoſe contradictions were reall, why did not antiquity note them, as it noted their differences about ſmaller diſputable matters. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> took pains to note the errors of <hi>Origen;</hi> yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all they did not note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> now holds, though his writings be full there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If the ſentences of the <hi>Fathers</hi> be true in the ſenſe that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them, why did not ſome charge them for maintaining the contrary <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Doctrines,</hi> a thouſand times more frequently mentioned in their writings? And on the other ſide, if the <hi>Romane Doctrines</hi> were true, why did not ſome tax them for maintaining of <hi>Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme?</hi> doubtleſſe they would if they had underſtood them in the ſenſe that <hi>Protestants</hi> now do. It is manifeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they that lived in thoſe times (who were therefore better able to underſtand their meanings, than the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> that are ſprung up ſo many hundred yeares after) did not conceive that the <hi>Fathers</hi> maintained the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> doctrines in their writings; for if they had, they would quickly have been reproved

               <argument>
                  <p>That the true <hi>Church</hi> may be knowne by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks; and that ſuch markes agree only to the Roman Church. And firſt of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality,</hi> the firſt mark of the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. IN further purſuit of the true <hi>Church,</hi> I addreſſed my ſelf, by the <hi>marks</hi> thereof to find it out. For I accounted it vaine to try by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> whether the particular doctrines of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> were the doctrines of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> unleſſe I could find their <hi>Church</hi> to be the true <hi>Church,</hi> by the marks of the true <hi>Church</hi> ſet down in <hi>Scripture.</hi> For either the <hi>Scripure</hi> can clear all controverſies, or it canntot; if it cannot, there will be no end of controverſie amongſt them that rely only on <hi>Scripture;</hi> if it can, then ſurely it can clear this moſt important one, <hi>which is the true Church,</hi> by the marks thereof; and if ſo, it is fit that that ſhould be determined in the firſt place, on which all the reſt depends,<note place="margin">Ep. dedic.</note> as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Feild</hi> acknowledgeth. And whereas ſome <hi>Protestants</hi> make the truth of the doctrine to be the onely mark of the <hi>Church,</hi> it is prepoſterous, being the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105178:85"/> declaration of a thing obſcure, or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be ſo, by a thing more obſcure; in as much as to know the truth of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in all the particular inſtances, is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than to know the ſociety of the <hi>Church.</hi> And it is neceſſary to know the truth of doctrine in all the particulars, before we can thereby know the true <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe if ſhe erre in any one point of faith, ſhe thereby falls from the title of the true <hi>Church.</hi> Now who is he that can boaſt to know the integrity of the doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> in all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular controverſies, againſt every ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that holds the contrary, by infallible proofs of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and invincible anſwers to all their objections? If any could do this, who knowes not that ignorant and unlearned people (of whoſe ſalvation notwithſtanding God hath the ſame care, as of the learned, and to whom the marks of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould be equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſince they are equally obliged to obey her) are not capable of this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?<note place="margin">Cont. Ep. Fund. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>For the reſt of the people (ſaith</hi> S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine) <hi>it is not the quickneſſe of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but the ſimplicity of belief that ſecure them.</hi>

               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:105178:85"/>
               <p>Therefore it is manifeſt, that they muſt have other marks to know the <hi>Church</hi> by, than that of her Doctrine; namely, marks proportionable to their capacity; to wit, externall and ſenſible marks, as <hi>eminency, antiquity, perpetuity,</hi> with the like; even as children and ignorant people muſt have externall and ſenſible marks, and other than the eſſentiall forme of a man, to know and diſcern a man from other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures. Elſe how could S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, God hath made in the Church <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to the end we ſhould be no more little children, blown about with every wind of doctrine, Epheſ.</hi> chap. 4. ver. 11. if hee had not given us other marks to know the <hi>Church</hi> than the purity of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Beſides purity of Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſſentiall form of the <hi>Church,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a mark of it, becauſe they are commonly repugnant and incompatible conditions. For the mark doth commonly demonſtrate the thing to the ſenſe, and the eſſentiall form doth ſhew it to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; the mark deſignes the thing in exiſtence, the eſſentiall forme deſignes it in eſſence; the mark ſhewes where the thing is, the eſſentiall form teaches what
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105178:86"/> it is; the mark is ſooner known than the thing; and contrariwiſe the thing is ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner known than the eſſentiall form of the thing;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Phyſ. c.</hi> 1.</note> for the thing defined (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) is known before the definition. A <hi>Mark</hi> then muſt have three conditions; The firſt is to be more known then the thing, ſince it is that, which makes the thing to be known. The ſecond, that the thing be never found without it. The third, that it be never found without the thing, either alone, if it be a totall mark, or with its fellowes, if it be a mark in part. According to theſe conditions, I found divers <hi>Marks</hi> ſet down in <hi>Scripture</hi> appliable only to the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Of which the firſt is to be <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> that is, <hi>univerſall;</hi> which was fore-told by the <hi>Prophet Eſay,</hi> ſaying, <hi>All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall flow unto it, Eſay</hi> 2.2.

               <p>And that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church</hi> diſperſed over the whole world, is manifeſt to all thoſe that have either read the hiſtories of the world, or have been eye-witneſſes of the ſeverall Countreys thereof; wherein though the publike profeſſion thereof be <hi>Hereticall, Mahometicall,</hi> or <hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> yet even there hath the <hi>Romane Catholique Church</hi> both <hi>Fathers</hi> and children, <hi>Pastors</hi> and people. And like the Sea, what ſhe loſeth in one place, ſhe wins in another; what ſhe hath loſt by the falling away of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhe hath gained with increaſe, by the propagation of her faith in the <hi>Eaſt and Weſt Indies,</hi> where whole Kingdomes are converted thereunto; as a <hi>Proteſtant Author</hi> confeſſeth, ſaying,<note place="margin">Simon Lythus in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpons. altera ad alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Gretſeri Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiam. p. <hi>333.</hi>

               <p>And whereas <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay that this <hi>univerſality</hi> is no true mark of the <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe it is appliable to <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> it is doubtleſſe a very poor objection; for the markes of the <hi>Church</hi> are not given her by God, to diſtinguiſh her from all ſorts of <hi>Religions,</hi> but only from thoſe that are contained equivocally under the ſame next kind, and may be ſuppoſed and taken for <hi>Churches;</hi> that is to ſay, from other Chriſtian ſocieties, to wit, from Hereticall and Shiſmaticall Sects, which challenge by falſe markes the title of the true <hi>Church:</hi> To which purpoſe S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with the Donatiſts, <hi>Thou askeſt of a ſtranger whether he be a Pagan or a Chriſtian, he anſwers thee, a Chriſtian; thou askeſt him whether he be a catechumene,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath this forme of <hi>univerſality,</hi> beyond all <hi>Religions</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:105178:87"/> of the world, even <hi>Turkes</hi> or <hi>Heathens;</hi> That there is no place of the known world where there are not <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> propagating their <hi>Religion,</hi> by converting the people of the land, whoſoever they are; which is manifeſtly wanting to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions, and is therefore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard alſo more univerſally ſpread over the face of the earth than any other. Others ſay that this univerſall ſpreading of the <hi>Church</hi> is antidated by <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> with application to themſelves, for that it was not to take beginning, but from the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> becauſe ſome places of Scripture which ſpeak of the largeneſſe of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſay it ſhall be in the later daies. But it is manifeſt, that by later daies, is meant all the ſpace of time from <hi>Chirſt</hi> to the end of the world; as S. <hi>Peter</hi> (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting a prophecie of <hi>Joel,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>that it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt daies, that God will powre his Spirit upon all fleſh, Acts</hi> 2.17. by which is intended the amplitude of the <hi>Church</hi>) applies it to that preſent time when the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcended upon the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Nor can any reaſonable man imagine that it can ſort with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and his tender love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to ſuffer the light of his truth (in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105178:88"/> not ſpreading of his <hi>Church</hi>) to be eclipſed for 14. or 1500. years, ſeeing that according to the opinion of ſome learned men, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon fair probabilities, the world is likely to laſt but 2000. yeares after <hi>Christ.</hi> Howſoever this univerſality of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion</hi> is but begun, it is not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is yet actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding larger; and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that allow this for a mark of the true <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; now begin hopefully to apply it to themſelves, are bound to be of the <hi>Roman,</hi> till they ſee their expectation ſatisfied, in the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> exceeding her in latitude; which I dare boldly ſay will not be as long as they live, and therefore they ought to die in the <hi>Roman Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. But if we examine the matter a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more ſtrictly, we ſhall find, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> plea for univerſality wilbe cut very ſhort, when we conſider, that though they make themſelves all of one <hi>Church,</hi> when they would vie for multitude with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church;</hi> yet compared with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſhall find that they are very many <hi>Churches;</hi> not diſtinguiſhed by nation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by doctrine and points of faith; and that there are many Churches in one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in <hi>England</hi> for example, and will be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105178:88"/> many more, if the deſired <hi>Independency</hi> be advanced. Now it is not ſufficient that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in generall be enlarged, but it muſt be the true <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which every particular Sect thinking it ſelf to be of, and denying it (the moſt of them) to the reſt, the <hi>univerſality</hi> of the <hi>Religion</hi> wilbe mightily abated. Indeed when they muſter their ſtrengths together, and make boaſt of their greatneſſe, then they rake all into the title of <hi>Protestantiſme,</hi> who have revolted from the <hi>Roman Church</hi> &amp; count them on their ſide; as if the definition of a <hi>Protestant</hi> were, <hi>one that is oppoſite to the Church of Rome;</hi> So that if there were a thouſand ſorts of <hi>Heretiques</hi> in the world, they would in this caſe account them but one <hi>Church.</hi> But the word <hi>Catholique</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a note of <hi>Communion,</hi> (as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already;) as the <hi>Roman Church</hi> calls none a <hi>Catholique</hi> that doth not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with her; ſo cannot the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> of <hi>Engl.</hi> count any to be of her <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> thereby (by inlarging of her bounds) to prove her ſelfe <hi>Catholique,</hi> unleſſe they will communicate with her, which the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Churches</hi> wil not, the <hi>Lutheran Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes</hi> will not, many of the Sects within the Kingdom will not, as <hi>Preſbyterians, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,

               </p>
               <p n="4">§ 4 Laſtly, the very poſſeſſion of the name <hi>Catholique</hi> is a proof, that it doth belong to her, ſeeing no ſort of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> elſe can uſurp it from her.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. THe ſecond mark of the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Antiquity;</hi> as God ſaith by the <hi>Prophet Jeremy, Stand in the waies &amp; ſee, &amp; inquire of the old paths, which is the good way, and walk therein, Ier.</hi> 6.16. And our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. that the good ſeed was ſown firſt, and afterwards the tares. And even in nature truth is before falſhood. And this <hi>Antiquity</hi> I found applyable in the higheſt degree to the <hi>Roman Religion;</hi> for though ſome hereſies are very antient, as is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that the tares were ſowen ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the good ſeed, yet the truth is more antient, and ſo is the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> This antiquity of hers, for the greateſt part of time, is confeſſed by <hi>Protestants, Perkins,</hi> (whom I alledged before) grants it for 900. yeares; <hi>Napier</hi> goes higher, and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:105178:92"/> ſaith it raigned univerſally and without any debateable contradiction 12. hundred and 60. yeares. And ſeeing this raign of the <hi>Catholique Religion,</hi> which <hi>Protestants</hi> call <hi>Popery,</hi> was then univerſall, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that it did not then begin; for ſuch an univerſall poſſeſſion could not be got on the ſuddain, as they may perceive by the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which is not improved to neere that univerſality in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred yeares; ſo that in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability (even according to the opinion of <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) the beginning thereof muſt be in, or neere the <hi>Apostles</hi> times.</p>
               <p>Now whether we take the <hi>Roman Church</hi> for the ſociety of <hi>Christians</hi> that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for their head, or whether we take it for <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> holding the doctrines of the preſent <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> in both reſpects it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is moſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and <hi>Apoſtolicall.</hi> The former is proved by the teſtimony of S.<note n="*" place="margin">Iren. cont.

               <p>The main thing that they deny is the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the doctrine of the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> for they ſay the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> taught the <hi>Proteſtant Doctrine</hi> and not that which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> now teacheth; Which I found to be falſe, by the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105178:93"/> of particulars; all which if I ſhould here ſet down, I ſhould ſwell this intended little <hi>Treatiſe</hi> into a huge Volume. It ſhall ſuffice me therefore to give a ſcant map of the <hi>Churches</hi> doctrine in the Primitive times, and the teſtimony of ſome <hi>Fathers</hi> of the firſt five hundred yeares, of every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall age ſome, in the proof of ſome of the preſent <hi>Catholique doctrines,</hi> moſt ſtrongly oppoſed by <hi>Protestants;</hi> referring him that is deſirous of larger proof, to the painefull volumes of <hi>Coccius</hi> and <hi>Gualte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> Noting firſt two things by the way: The former, that it is not neceſſary that <hi>Catholiques</hi> ſhould give this proof; For it is ſufficient that they are in poſſeſſion of this faith, and that they all ſay they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from their <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> and they from theirs, and ſo upward to the firſt beginning of <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> and that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> cannot by any ſufficient teſtimony of <hi>Fathers</hi> or hiſtories prove the contrary; a thing which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> no doubt would highly boaſt of, if they were able to performe it in their owne behalf. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, that many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do confeſſe, that the antient <hi>Fathers</hi> did hold many points of belief of the preſent <hi>Roman Church; Whitguift Archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>

                  <q>almoſt all the Biſhops and Writers of the Greek Church, and Latine alſo, for the moſt part, were ſpotted with the doctrines of free will, of merit, of invocation of Saints, and ſuch like.</q> And the like is affirmed by many others, in many other points; as is largely ſhewed by the book entituled, <hi>The Proteſtants Apologie for the Roman Church.</hi> Againſt which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, but that which is worſe than nothing, to wit, that they were the ſpots and blemiſhes of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> And who I pray are they that undertake to correct <hi>Magnificat</hi> (as we ſay) and like <hi>Goliah</hi> to defie the whole hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> But they ſay, that a dwarf ſtanding upon a Giants ſhoulders, may ſee further than the Giant can; and ſo they by peruſing the <hi>Fathers,</hi> may ſee further than the <hi>Fathers</hi> could; Further perhaps they may, in ſome caſes, but never contrary; they cannot by their help ſee that to be black, which they ſaw to be white; that to be falſe, which they ſaw to be true.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To the children of the <hi>Church</hi> it is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that for the redreſſe of their grievances, they <hi>tell the Church, Mat.</hi> 81.17. which were a deluſion unleſſe the Church were alwaies viſible: who did alſo forewarn us againſt all obſcure congregations, ſaying, <hi>If therefore they ſhall ſay unto you, behold he is in the deſert, go you not forth, behold he is in ſecret places, believe it not, Mat.</hi> 24.26. Now according to theſe aſſurances, I found, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was alwaies and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently viſible, but the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and for the moſt part, not viſible at all. Concerning the <hi>viſibility</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> it is proved before, by thoſe teſtimonies which ſhew the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; perpetuall continuance thereof, which cannot be proved but with the granting of her <hi>viſibility.</hi> Nor have I found the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> denying it, the thing being ſo viſible, that it leaves no place for objections. But
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105178:111"/> they think to wipe out this mark, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is not neceſſary to a true <hi>Church</hi> to be alwaies viſible: but others diſliking that aſſertion, by reaſon of the abſurdity thereof, do affirme, (to counterpoize the <hi>Roman</hi>) that the <hi>Protestant Church</hi> hath been alwaies viſible.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. And firſt, they that hold that the <hi>Church</hi> hath been inviſible, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore viſibility is not a certain mark of the <hi>Church,</hi> indeavour to prove it by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the daies of <hi>Elias,</hi> 3 <hi>King.</hi> 19.10.18. who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that the <hi>Prophets</hi> were ſlaine, and he only was left alive, and God anſwered, that there were left ſeven thouſand that had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> To which objection I found the anſwer of <hi>Catholiques</hi> very true, namely, that this complaint of <hi>Elias</hi> was uttered with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely, wherein <hi>Elias</hi> then was, and was perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by King <hi>Ahab;</hi> but in the Kingdome of <hi>Judah,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> did floriſh, and was ſufficiently known to him, and all men, under the reigns of <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Joſhaphat</hi> 3 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.41. who reigned in <hi>Judah</hi> when <hi>Achab</hi> reigned in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As what time the number of true believers was ſo great,

               <p>And whereas M. <hi>Meade</hi> makes reply to this anſwer, ſaying, <hi>that the Church was inviſible, in the Kingdome of Iudah alſo, in the daies of Manaſſes</hi> becauſe it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. that <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſet up Idolatry, committed all impiety, and cauſed <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to erre; I anſwer, that this comes ſhort of a proof; for though the Kings example in all caſes, though never ſo bad, have a mighty influence on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet this proves not but that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or an eminent part, or at leaſt a viſible part both of <hi>Priests</hi> and people, was ſtill untainted; even as it was in the daies of the perſecution of <hi>Antiochus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who ſet up the <hi>Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of deſolation,</hi> the Idoll of <hi>Olympick Jupiter,</hi> in the Temple, and compelled men to worſhip it. Beſides, if it were as he would have it, the caſe is much different between a very ſhort time of the inviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> (for we read in the ſame Chapter, that <hi>Manaſſes</hi> quickly repented, and amended all) and the inviſibility of the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> which by their own confeſſions was above

Alſo the compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> is not equall: the <hi>New Testament</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed in <hi>better promiſes, Heb.</hi> 8.6. and therefore that may be incident to the one, which is not to the other.

                  <hi>in time of perſecution, the true Church may be reputed an impious Sect by the multitude, and ſo not be known by the notion of true and holy, nor can her truth be diſcerned by ſenſe and common reaſon.</hi> To which I anſwer: that as there are four properties of <hi>Church-doctrine,</hi> ſo there are foure notions of the <hi>Church.</hi> The firſt is to bee Miſtreſſe of ſaving truth; and according to this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Church</hi> is inviſible to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall underſtanding both of men and Angells; for God only and his Bleſſed ſee our Religion to be the truth. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is to be Miſtreſſe of Doctrine truly revealed by ſecret inſpiration: according to this notion (ordinarily ſpeaking) the <hi>Church</hi> is inviſible to almoſt all men that are, or ever were, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> only excepted. The third, to be Miſtreſſe of the Doctrine which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> by their preaching and miracles planted in the world: according to this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Church</hi> was viſible to the firſt and Primitive times; but now is not. The fourth is to be Miſtreſſe of <hi>Catholique doctrine;</hi> that is, of Doctrine delivered &amp; received by full <hi>Tradition</hi> and profeſſion, all the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105178:113"/> thereof (that are under the title of <hi>Chriſtian</hi>) being divided amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and notorious changers; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this notion the <hi>Church</hi> is ever vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſenſible to all men, even to her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Otherwiſe there is no ordinary meanes left for men to know what the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> taught, nor conſequently what God by inſpiration revealed to them. And if ſhe and the light of truth ſhe carries with her, ſhould be hidden and loſt, we muſt begin again anew, from a ſecond fountain of immediate revelation from God, and build upon the new planting thereof with Miracles in the world, by ſome new <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi> And if this be abſurd; then there muſt ever be in the world a <hi>Church</hi> viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> are famouſly <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> and conſequently ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the <hi>Apostles,</hi> to all men that will not be obſtinate.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Church</hi> ſhall be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally viſible even in the daies of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> may be gathered out of the <hi>Scripture, Rev.</hi> 20.8. For ſhe ſhall then be every where perſecuted, which could not be, unleſſe ſhe were viſible, and conſpicuous even to the wicked.

                  <hi>Century-writers,</hi> and ſundry others do take certain and particular notice of the <hi>Catholique Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> by name, in thoſe very ages; of their adminiſtration of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and their open impugning of <hi>Hereſies.</hi> And ſurely our Lord himſelf had been (which is blaſphemy to think of him, who is the eternall wiſdome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the moſt imprudent of all Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, to have a Law ſo obſcure, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſo many ſuppoſitions, depravations, and falſe expoſitions, whereto the malice of the <hi>Heretiques</hi> of all ages hath ſubjected it, without leaving a depoſitory to keep it, and a judge to interpret it, or to leave it to ſuch a keeper, and ſuch a judge as ſhould be inviſible.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Other <hi>Proteſtants</hi> I have obſerved, who though they confeſſe the inviſibility of their <hi>Church,</hi> yet profeſſe the being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and aſſigne the place for it, to be in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> mixed like a great deal of ore with a very little pure gold, ſo that it was not diſcernable. But this aſſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>Church</hi> ſeemed to me very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105178:114"/> for either thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did profeſſe their owne faith, or they did not; if they did, then doubtleſſe they were viſible, and the <hi>Roman Church</hi> would ſoon have taken notice of them, as ſhe did in all ages of ſuch (though it were but one man) that differed from her. If they did not make profeſſion of their faith, what wretched ſonnes of fear were they, that to preſerve their temporall ſecurity durſt not publiquely avow their own <hi>Religion;</hi> but comply in all things with a <hi>Religion</hi> (in their opinion) falſe and impious, and diſſemblingly do all the externall acts thereof, and this, all their lives, for many generations ſucceſſively.</p>
               <p>This was not the part of a true <hi>Church,</hi> or of any true member thereof; who will ſurely die, rather than deny his <hi>Saviour;</hi> as he doth, who believing himſelfe to be of the true <hi>Religion,</hi> makes profeſſion of that which he deemes to be falſe. Nor did they fulfill the Propheſie of <hi>Eſay</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true <hi>Church,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>I have ſet watchmen upon thy walls, which ſhall never hold their peace day nor night, Eſay</hi> 62.6. But <hi>Doctor Feild</hi> hath a new fancy of his owne, which I never obſerved in any but himſelfe, who ſaith to this purpoſe, that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105178:114"/> before the ſeparation of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> it ſelfe was the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> and that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were but a faction of the <hi>Court of Rome;</hi> an aſſertion ſo groſly falſe, that all the world is a witneſſe againſt it, yea even (I think) all other <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves, and needs no confutation.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Others taking all theſe <hi>Pleas</hi> for inſufficient, do affirm that their <hi>Church</hi> was in being, and in ſight alſo in all ages, but that through the injury of later times no teſtimony thereof is now remaining, but that all their records through the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergie, have been utterly ſuppreſſed: Of which vaine conceipt there is no proof at all; and if the aſſertion without proof will ſerve their turne, it may ſerve alſo for any other <hi>Religion, Chriſtian,</hi> or not <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who if they pleaſe, may ſay the ſame thing, but are never like to be believed by any man of common underſtanding.

Firſt they were not of the ſame <hi>Religion;</hi> for to be of the ſame <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imports an agreement in all points of faith; for the truth of doctrine being of the eſſence of the <hi>Church,</hi> whoſoever erres in any little thereof, he ceaſeth to participate of the ſoule of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> and is but a dead member, one equivocally and in name, but not in truth. We ſee that the <hi>Arrians, Macedonians,</hi> and many other <hi>Heretiques,</hi> were accounted, (and are ſo by many <hi>Protestants</hi>) not of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church,</hi> for one ſingle error againſt faith: now the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> diſagreeing in many points, not only from one another at this preſent, but from all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and that in points which they believe to be revealed in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> their only rule; are neither one <hi>Church</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves at this preſent, nor any one of them one, with any ſociety that hath gone before.</p>
               <p>In particular, the <hi>Grecians</hi> whom they court to their faction, are no <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for they hold damnable errors in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105178:116"/> of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> to wit; <hi>Invocation of Saints; Adoration of Images; Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; Communion</hi> in one kind for the ſick, with many others. So that <hi>Protestants</hi> are in great penury of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of their Religion before <hi>Luther;</hi> that are forced to call the <hi>Grecians</hi> in, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in eſſence; for they may even as well name the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe. As for <hi>John Huſſe</hi> and his followers, who brake out about the year 1400. and are claimed to be Predeceſſors in the <hi>Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it is certaine that they were no <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> but held ſuch Doctrines that if they were now in <hi>England,</hi> they ſhould ſuffer as <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For they held<note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>The like may be ſaid of the <hi>Albigenſes;</hi> and alſo of <hi>Beringarius,</hi> who broached his Hereſie about the yeare 1048. who was a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> but onely in the point againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which he alſo recanted, and died a <hi>Catholique.</hi> And what do any of theſe, or all theſe together availe the <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> every one of them extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but to ſome part of time between this and the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and is alſo but the example of ſome one or other private man, in whom the revolt firſt began, who was firſt a <hi>Catholike,</hi> and beginning after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to hold ſome one or few points of the <hi>Proteſtant faith,</hi> continued in all other matters of controverſie a <hi>Catholique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which it appeares, that none of theſe were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and that therefore in them the viſibility of the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> is not maintained: And that if it were, yet ſeeing they lived at ſeverall times, ununited by a line of time one to another, (but jumping over ſeverall ages, againſt the Law of nature, which <hi>non facit ſaltum</hi>) and that therfore in the between-ſpaces, there was an inviſibility of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church;</hi> the main queſtion of their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:105178:118"/> 
                  <hi>Churches</hi> perpetuall viſibility is yet unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Eſpecially when we conſider that for about a thouſand yeares, which was the time betwixt <hi>Beringarius</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> the <hi>Protestants</hi> pretend to no prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. As for the moſt <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> whom they affirm to maintain the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Doctrine,</hi> I have in brief ſhewed it to be falſe already, and they that will ſearch ſhall more largely find it ſo. Alſo they all died members of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> So that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have not in them (to wit the <hi>Fathers</hi>) a <hi>viſible Church,</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Roman,</hi> nor was the <hi>Roman</hi> theirs. From whence it is manifeſt, that there is not any one <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> in the world, that can ſhew her viſibility in any Kingdome, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, poor countrey village, or particular perſon from the <hi>Apostles</hi> time to <hi>Luther;</hi> the truth wherof M. <hi>Wotton</hi> is not aſhamed to confeſſe, where he ſaith (<hi>in his anſwer to a Popiſh Pamphlet p.</hi> 11.) <hi>You will ſay; ſhew us where the faith &amp; religion you profeſſe were held? Nay prove you they were held no where, &amp;c. and what if it could not be ſhewed? yet we know by the Articles of our Creed, that there hath been alwaies a Church, in which we ſay, this Religion we now profeſſe muſt of neceſſity be held, &amp; with us it is no inconvenience to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:105178:118"/> have the true Church hid. This ſtands you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſprove, which when you attempt to do by any particular records, you ſhal have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular anſwer.</hi> Than which ſaying, what more ridiculous? To preſume that their <hi>Church</hi> was alwaies <hi>viſible</hi> (in the land of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> ſure, where no man ever ſaw it) becauſe it is the true <hi>Church,</hi> wheras they ſhould prove it the true <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <hi>viſible;</hi> the knowledge of her <hi>viſibility</hi> being much more eaſie than of her <hi>truth,</hi> which is the main thing in controverſie. And to require of <hi>Catholiques</hi> proof, that they were not viſible, by particular records, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme fooliſh; records being memorialls of things that were, not of things that were not.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. All which conſiderations, ſhaking the confidence of many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the viſibility of their <hi>Church</hi> before <hi>Luther,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have thus fluttered up and down, finding (like the <hi>Dove</hi> out of the <hi>Arke</hi>) no reſt for the ſole of their foot, they at laſt fly to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> &amp; think to pearch upon that; under whoſe obſcurity, and their corruption of them, while they will admit none to interpret them but themſelves, they frame what ſenſe they pleaſe, as any bodie els may do, &amp; with great confidence, but little judgement (as all Heretikes do)
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:105178:119"/> aſſure themſelves thereof. But if they will allow the <hi>Fathers</hi> for good interpreters, as none but thoſe that are puffed up with the Spirit of Pride, will refuſe to do; then we find (as I ſhewed before) that even <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were of the <hi>Roman,</hi> not the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the firſt Founders and publiſhers thereof.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Doctor White</hi> (in his <hi>Reply. p.</hi> 105.) concludes thus, <hi>that this notwithſtanding if Proteſtants be able to demonſtrate by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they maintaine the ſame faith and religion which the Apoſtles taught, this alone is ſufficient to prove them to be the true Church.</hi> But they that cannot by the markes of the <hi>Church</hi> ſet downe in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> cleere themſelves to be the true <hi>Church,</hi> do moſt fondly appeale to <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to ſhew the truth of their particular points. For what more vaine, than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſetting things down cleerly, unto <hi>Scripture,</hi> teaching matters obſcurely, or not ſo cleerly? Now no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular point of doctrine, is in holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſo manifeſtly ſet down, as is the <hi>Church</hi> and the markes whereby we may know her.

                  <p>Of the fourth mark of the true Church (viz.) <hi>a lawfull ſucceſſion and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vocation and miſſion of Paſtors;</hi> And that it is ridiculous to affirme, that Catholiques and Proteſtants are the ſame Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. A Fourth mark of the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>perſonall ſucceſſion of Paſtors,</hi> and their miſſion by ordinary callings; which is alwaies to be found in the true <hi>Church,</hi> as is foretold by the <hi>Prophet</hi> Eſay, ch. 59. v. 2. <hi>My ſpirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, from henceforth for ever.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſaith of our <hi>Saviour, Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.12. that he appointed <hi>Paſtors</hi> and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the <hi>Church, to the conſummation of the Saints, for the work of the ministery, for the edifying of the body of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>till we all meet in the unity of the faith.</hi> And this charge is not to be undertaken by uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by lawfull calling and miſſion; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>No man takes to himſelfe this honour, but he that is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105178:120"/> called of God, as Aron was,</hi> to wit viſibly, and by peculiar conſecration. And againe, <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent? Rom.</hi> 10.15. And our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>who ſo entreth not by the doore into the ſheepfold, but climeth another way, is a thief, John</hi> 10.5. And God in the old Teſtament reproves thoſe that went without miſſion, ſaying, <hi>J have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran, Jeremy</hi> 23.21. <hi>I have not ſent them, ſaith the Lord, yet they prophecie faſly in my name, Jer.</hi> 27.15. And this is a note of the <hi>Church</hi> ſo pertinent, that S. <hi>Auguſtine (Lib. cont. Epiſt. Fundament. c.</hi> 4.) ſaith, <hi>the ſucceſſion of Prieſts, from the very Seat of Peter the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, to whom the Lord commited his ſheep to be fed, even to the preſent Biſhoprick, doth hold me in the Church.</hi> And <hi>Optatus Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitanus</hi> reckons all the <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> from S. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Syricius,</hi> who then was <hi>Pope,</hi> to ſhew that the <hi>Church</hi> was not then with the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who by like ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not aſcend up to the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and then (<hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Parmenianum</hi>) he addes, <hi>Shew you the originall of your chaire, who challenge the holy Church to your ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this mark is found upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> I know no man that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105178:121"/> denies. But the <hi>Biſhops</hi> (where they are) and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thus derive themſelves from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. The <hi>Roman Church</hi> indeed made <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſt,</hi> and gave him Commiſſion to preach her Doctrine, but to preach againſt her Religion, who gave him order? That Commiſſion (ſeeing he had it not from any Church) he had either from himſelf, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Religion out of his owne braine, coloured with abuſed <hi>Scripture,</hi> which he then proudly pretended to know better than all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world beſide;<note n="g" place="margin">Tom <hi>7.</hi> VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg. fo. <hi>228</hi>
                  </note> or from the Devill, with whom he conferred, and to whoſe arguments he yeelded, as himſelf confeſſeth.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſucceſſion of the <hi>Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> was interrupted upon their pretended <hi>Reformation;</hi> the lawfull <hi>Biſhops</hi> being turned out, and others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their place, by the temporall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> in chief; which had no power to chooſe or conſecrate <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and ordain <hi>Priests.</hi> Or if they were at firſt conſecrated by lawful Biſhops of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as for their credit they pretend, yet they had not thereby Commiſſion to preach their new Doctrine differing from
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105178:121"/> the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> nor howſoever is their ſucceſſion lawfull; for in a lawfull ſucceſſion, it is required that the former <hi>Biſhops</hi> be dead, or lawfully depoſed; but theſe conditions were not obſerved in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Catholique Biſhops</hi> being violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt out, by the Authority of Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> aſſuming to her ſelf the title of <hi>head of the Church,</hi> a thing never arrogated by any temporall Prince of the world, untill her Father <hi>King Henry</hi> the eight gave the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>But it is worth the obſervation, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the lawfulneſſe of their ſucceſſion, do affirm, that they were conſecrated by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Biſhops,</hi> their predeceſſors, which while they do not prove, it ſhewes the interruption of their ſucceſſion, and while they affirm, it ſhewes that they believe their ſucceſſion and calling inſufficient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they derive it from the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> thereby acknowledging the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> the true <hi>Church,</hi> which they in their Doctrine and dependence have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; and there can be no reaſon to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the true <hi>Church</hi> upon what pretence ſoever. For the errors of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are but ſuppoſed, and their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105178:122"/> neither is but ſuppoſed, they being infallibily ſure of nothing, ſince they hold their <hi>Church</hi> may erre, and ſo for ought ought they certainly know, it did, in accu- and forſaking the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and in their own imaginary amendment, and inſtead of <hi>Christ</hi> have choſen <hi>Barrabas.</hi> And what can be more inconſiderate, than to forſake the true <hi>Church</hi> (by their own confeſſion) upon pretences, of whoſe truth they are (by their own confeſſion alſo) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.

               <p>If <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, that they that were condemned in thoſe <hi>Councells</hi> did indeed hold Hereſies, and ſo were not the <hi>Church,</hi> but their own are truths and amendments of the Doctrine of the <hi>Church;</hi> I anſwer, ſo did thoſe <hi>Heretiques</hi> alſo ſay, yea and prove it by <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> in their own ſenſe, and did believe their Doctrines to be the pure Word of God, as confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as any <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the world do theirs; who cannot ſay more for themſelves than they did, and they were (ſome of them) as numerous and as learned, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are; nor was there more authority againſt them than againſt the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> which is, The <hi>Catholique Roman Church,</hi> guided by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and the Word of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten &amp; unwritten.

Moreover, God hath made the Church the <hi>Judge,</hi> ſaying, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> and that is the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt grant, who ſay, they are one with it, and that it was the <hi>Church,</hi> when they revolted from her.</p>
               <p>And to conſider the matter, according to reaſon, ſeen in the practiſe of all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and bodies, whether Eccleſiaſticalll or Civill; if any one or few members break the law and rule of the whole, who ſhall judge whether it be well or ill done?

               <p>And whereas <hi>Proteſtants</hi> magnifie their own charity, in this kind conceit of theirs, and accuſe <hi>Catholiques</hi> of the want therof, it is very idle; for the controverſie about the meanes of ſalvation, and the <hi>Church</hi> wherein it is to be had, is not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the judgement of charity, but of diſcretion. <hi>Catholiques</hi> judge no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man to be damned, becauſe they know not the operations of God upon his ſoule in his lateſt minutes; but they judge that all men out of the <hi>Roman Catholique Church</hi> are out of the road of ſalvation, becauſe they are aſſured thereof by the word of God. And if to grant the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſalvation to others, be ſuch a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of charity, as they conceive; then ſurely <hi>Origen</hi> was of all men moſt charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who held that at the laſt, even the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills themſelves ſhould be ſaved, and yet I find no man agreeing with him in this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. A Fifth <hi>Mark</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in <hi>doctrine:</hi> of which it is ſaid by S. <hi>Paul, I beſeech you that all ſpeak one thing, be ye knit together in one mind, and one judgement;</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105178:125"/> bond of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 4.3. <hi>Continue in one Spirit and one mind,</hi> Philip. 1.27. <hi>of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and one judgement,</hi> Philip 2.2. Thus in the firſt times <hi>were the multitude of them that believed of one heart and one ſoule,</hi> Acts 4.32. Thus our <hi>Saviour</hi> prayeth (and no doubt was heard) <hi>that they may be one: John</hi> 17.11. and the effect of that prayer, we ſee in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and no where elſe. Thus alſo the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> deſcribes the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> ſaying, <hi>my dove is one, Cant.</hi> 6.8. And the want of this unity is ſo improper to God, that he is therefore termed, <hi>the God, not of diſſention, but of peace,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. And it is ſuch an aſſured meanes to ſhorten continuance, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, <hi>if you bite and devoure one another, take heed that you be not conſumed one of another, Galat.</hi> 5.15. and that <hi>a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome divided againſt it ſelf ſhall periſh, Luc.</hi> 11.17. And by the want of this mark of <hi>unity,</hi> did the antient <hi>Fathers</hi> diſcover the Heretiques of their times. S. <hi>Cryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Op. imperfect. in Math. Hom.</hi> 20.) <q>All infidells that are under the devill, are not united nor hold the ſame things, but are diſperſed by divers opinions; one ſaith ſo, and another ſo, &amp;c. in the ſame manner are the falſhoods of Heretiques,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:105178:126"/> who never hold the ſame things, but have ſo many opinions, as there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</q> To the ſame purpoſe ſpeakes <hi>Jrenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Tertullian,</hi> and others, (<hi>Iren. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Tertull. de praeſc. adverſ. haer.</hi> 42.)</p>
               <p>And this unity I found apparently in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and the contrary as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent amongſt <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Thus the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient writers do wonderfully agree in all matters of faith; ſo alſo do all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of all lawfull <hi>Councells</hi> and <hi>Popes;</hi> though they were men living in ſeverall ages, in ſeverall countries, and wrote in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall languages: And now alſo all <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi> in the world, howſoever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe divided by country, language, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt, civill diſſentions, or war, yet agree exactly in all points of faith. And this becauſe they have a certaine compaſſe to ſteere by, to wit the <hi>generall Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the decrees of <hi>Generall Councells,</hi> who they have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, doe preſerve that which was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and if any doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe about the ſenſe of <hi>Scripture,</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to interpret it than any other perſons; to which therefore they doe modeſtly and wiſely ſubmit their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But no ſuch agreement was ever
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105178:126"/> found, or ever can bee found amongſt <hi>Protestants,</hi> or any ſort of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. S. <hi>Irenaeus (lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.) ſaith of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his Hereſie, that it was <hi>divided into ſeverall ſects.</hi> S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> of the <hi>Donatiſts, (lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Bapt. c.</hi> 6.) that in his time it was <hi>cut into ſmall threds.</hi> And particularly the ſame is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who ſoon after their ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were divided amongſt themſelves, and have ever ſince ſo continued, multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily in their diviſions; inſomuch that even in the one Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and even in the one City of <hi>London,</hi> there are very many: And in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular houſes there are ſome different Sects of Religion, each pretending to be the true <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and denying that title to the other.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any meanes to reconcile their differences, but they are rather like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to grow more, and greater, as wee ſee at this day. For no Sect will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge another its ſuperiour in matter of Religion, nor ſtand to its judgment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be by force; no not any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon thinks himſelf obliged to ſubmit to the whole world; therefore they
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:105178:127"/> uſe to ſay, <hi>that they will not pin their faith upon another mans ſleeve,;</hi> but all pretend to be guided by the Word of God, which each one will interpret for himſelfe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe all others of error ſo far as they diſſent from him. And though Sects and Hereſies do firſt ariſe out of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>There must be Hereſies;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. yet the <hi>Church</hi> doth not loſe her unity hereby; becauſe ſhe having a certain Touch-ſtone whereby to try them, namely, the judgement of the <hi>Church;</hi> if they will not ſubmit to that, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and by judiciall ſentence cut off from that body, from which they firſt cut themſelves by miſ-belief; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>an hereticall man after the firſt and ſecond admonition avoid, Tit.</hi> 3.10. whereby they preſerve the reſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy intire, and at unity within it ſelf. So that the Hereſies do not ariſe from the Doctrine of the Church, but from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Devill.</p>
               <p>But amongſt <hi>Protestants</hi> the liberty of reading and interpreting <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the examining and judging the <hi>Preachers</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thereby, being given to every ſilly ſoul, (as <hi>Doctor Bilſon</hi> ſaith,<note n="c" place="margin">True difference, part. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>353.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The people (are) diſcerners
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105178:127"/> and judges of that which is taught,</hi> as with good reaſon they ought; for it was upon this ground that they firſt ſeparated from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> undertaking to be judges of her Doctrine; and if the preſent Clergie ſhould not continue this liberty to the people againſt themſelves, who are no more infallible than the other, nor can pretend to it; they would play very foule play with the people, and (inſtead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them liberty of conſcience, which they promiſed, only tranſlate them from one Tyrant over their conſciences (ſo they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>) to another the <hi>Church of England</hi>) there muſt needs ariſe varieties of Sects in Religion, according to the various conceipt and apprehenſion of people, even out of the very nature of this their Doctrine, which is the ground-work for all the reſt; and is the moſt exerciſed in thoſe who are moſt converſant in the reading of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Puritans and Sectaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the many differences that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, they call no <hi>Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,</hi> nor indeed can they, by way of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, no Sect acknowledging it ſelf ſubject to anothers Juriſdiction, if it be under another temporall Governour;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105178:128"/> but conſtitutes a <hi>Church</hi> by it ſelfe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and independent. And in the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sects in any one Kingdome or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, neither party believing it ſelf juſtly ſubject to another in matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; But ſuppoſing themſelves alwayes in the truth, they think they are bound to maintain that truth, with the hazzard of their lives, and to oppoſe their lawfull <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes</hi> in the defence thereof; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they have power they put it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and turn <hi>Rebells</hi> for Gods ſake; As we ſee many have done heretofore, and the Engliſh are (many of them) now in the accurſed act. Nor can the men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe conduct the people do this, hope for more calme obedience from them, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than by force they are ſubdued to it, unleſſe they give them that in poſſeſſion, which now they have in hope, and for which they have all been united in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to wit, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to every particular perſon, to be of what Religion ſoever he ſhall make to himſelf out of the Bible, free, &amp; independent on the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any other.</p>
               <p>And with very good reaſon, for ſeeing they have all ſhaken off <hi>Chriſts</hi> yoke, why ſhould any <hi>man</hi> put a yoke upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105178:128"/> mans conſcience, and oblige him to believe, or do, or ſuffer that which is againſt <hi>his</hi> Word of God? Thus, as their Religion is diviſible according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſenſes of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſo Kingdomes are diviſible according to their Religions: So that there muſt ſtill be diviſion, either in Religion, or in War for the defence thereof. Yea ſo accurately doth <hi>Hereſie</hi> teach to run diviſion, that it is meerly by accident that any two <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are of the ſame Religion in any one point; for ſeeing they do not oblige themſelves to agree in any one Principle, but only the letter of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and refer the interpretation to themſelves, (as <hi>Chillingworth (Preface fine)</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let all men believe the Scripture, and that only, &amp; indeavour to believe it in the true ſenſe, and require no more of others,</hi>) it is but by the conſtitution of their brains, and the grain of their fancie running the ſame way, that brings any two of them to an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the ſame belief, concerning any point of Religion; which conſtitution, as it was accidentall in their generation, ſo it is daily changeable by age, education, and many other occurrences; and ſo alſo as uncertain for the future, as accidentall at the preſent.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:105178:129"/>
               <p>Thus all tends, to diviſion amongſt them, through the nature of their doctrines and the method of knowing and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them. And this diviſion of theirs in doctrine and opinion, is the reaſon, why when I mention the belief of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I uſually ſay, <hi>ſome Protestants,</hi> becauſe they are not all of a mind, ſcarce in any one point, wherein they differ from <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</hi> And ſome of them are ſo ſilly as to think, that if they themſelves doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch a point, no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> elſe doth, ſuppoſing all <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> included in their owne breſts; which indeed is nothing ſo: only they have reaſon, according to their principles, to believe (as they do) that that which every particular man holds, is the true <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> and ought to be a rule to all the world beſide.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. The <hi>Catholique Roman Church</hi> hath in it the propriety of heat, and doth <hi>congregare homogenea,</hi> gather together things of the ſame kind, and <hi>diſgregare he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogenea,</hi> ſeparate things that are of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures; caſting out of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion all ſorts of <hi>Heretiques.</hi> And on the contrary the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> hath the property of cold, which is <hi>congregare hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogenea,</hi> to gather together things of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:105178:129"/> natures, enfoulding under her name a miſcellane of Religions, freezing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and withall making them ſo brittle, that every chance breakes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmaller ſects and ſub-diviſions, which in the end will be the deſtruction of the whole, as it hath been of all foregoing he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies.</p>
               <p>And this truth Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Proteſtant (In his Relation of Religion of the Weſtern parts)</hi> confeſſeth, ſaying, <q>The Papiſts have the Pope, as a common father, adviſer, and conductor, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile their jarres, to decide their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to draw their Religion by conſent of Councells unto unity, &amp;c. whereas on the other ſide, Proteſtants are like ſevered or rather ſcattered troupes, each drawing adverſe way, without any meanes to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie their quarrells, no Patriarch one or more, to have a common ſuperintendency or care of their Churches, for correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and unity: no ordinary way to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a generall Councell on their part, the only hope remaining ever to aſſwage their contentions.</q> Of which ſeeing there is no hope, the ſword muſt be the Umpire. Which if it ſhould in <hi>England</hi> prevaile on the <hi>Puritane</hi> or <hi>Roundheads</hi> ſide, as they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:105178:130"/> now ſtile them, (which God forbid) I think I may without raſhneſſe ſay, that it falls out by the juſt judgement of God, that they that caſt out the <hi>Catholique Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Catholique Biſhops</hi> their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, upon pretence of the Reformation of Errors, which they diſcovered (as they ſaid) by the pure word of God, are upon the ſame pretences caſt out themſelves, and are forced to ſay with <hi>Adonibezek</hi> in the firſt of the book of Judges, <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath rewarded me.</hi> So true a rule it is, that <hi>he that practiſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his ſuperiours, teaches it to his inferiours.</hi>

               <p n="3">§. 3.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:105178:130"/> to be required of any ma that it ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as an Article of Faith, or be thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite or neceſſary to ſalvation:</hi> &amp; as nothing but what may be proved by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is by her accounted neceſſary to ſalvation, which is the ſame with fundamentall; ſo I ſuppoſe that all that can be proved by the <hi>Scripture</hi> is neceſſary to ſalvation, even in their own opinion; for I think they will not ſay, but that it is neceſſary and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to believe God, in all that he ſaith, whether the matter be great or ſmall; now <hi>Proteſtants</hi> profeſſing to believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neceſſarily, but what may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being in the things which they believe, it followes, that their differences are in things, which are proved by <hi>Scripture,</hi> that are the pure Word of God, and the meaning of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (as they uſe to ſpeak) and therefore muſt needs be (in the ſeverall opinions of them that hold them) fundamentall, and neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>

               <p n="4">§. 4. But the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> think to wipe off this ſtaine of diſagreement by retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> accuſing them of as great diſagreement, as is amongſt themſelves, which when I conſidered, I found altogether impertinent. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Catholiques</hi> there are two ſorts of points, ſome defined by the <hi>Church</hi> in a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> and ſo infallibly certain; others not defined; In the former they all exactly agree, in the later each man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the direction of his particular reaſon. Like to this, there are amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> certaine Articles (as they call them) which are agreed upon in each ſeverall dominion of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which are ſet down in their <hi>Harmony of confeſſions;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, firſt it is to be noted, that there is great diſagreement in generall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their <hi>Churches,</hi> they never meeting
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:105178:133"/> all together in any one <hi>Councell</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any one thing; ſo that they are not united in any one point by conſent. Then in particular dominions the decrees that they publiſh are not firmely believed by all under thoſe dominions, but are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as directions only, not obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Therefore in <hi>England</hi> many both of the people and Clergie alſo, doe deny, ſome one, ſome another particular, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their pleaſure; and yet the <hi>Generall Church</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the particular of <hi>England,</hi> doth ſuffer men, teaching and profeſſing contrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as points of faith, to abide in her communion, and paſſe under the name of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And ſeeing that of contrary doctrines one ſide muſt needs be falſe, while the <hi>Protestant Church</hi> permits both ſides to be preached, as matter of faith, and the Word of God, ſhe knowingly ſuffers the profeſſion of falſe doctrine, and ſo is the mother of falſhood, as much as truth, and therefore cannot be the true Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> doth not ſo, but if any preach or profeſſe contrary to that which is decreed, ſhe ſhuts them out of her Communion, and diſinherits them of the title of <hi>Catholique.</hi> As for other points,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:105178:134"/> which are without the compaſſe of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees (wherein there is a mighty latitude according to the extent of mens reaſons) ſhe permits every man to hold, as his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular underſtanding ſhall direct him. The <hi>Puritanes</hi> will have all governed by the written word of God; The <hi>Chillingwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> will have all guided by particular reaſon, and both ſorts differ amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> more wiſely in matters of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> is directed by the Word of God, either written, or unwritten, and therein her children ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver differ; or if they do, are renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; In Schoole points and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defined her children are guided by their particular reaſon; and herein they do and may differ, yet without diſunion, as well as in points of Philoſophie: For, Schoole points are not points of <hi>Religion</hi> properly; religion being derived <hi>à</hi> RELIGANDO, <hi>from binding;</hi> but in School points men are not bound to the belief of either ſide, but have free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to hold, or change, as they think they have cauſe, untill it be otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by a <hi>Councell.</hi> And this may be done, without the juſt imputation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, as S. <hi>Auguſtine (De Bapt. cont.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly there is in doctrines a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the concluſion or point of faith it ſelfe, and the reaſon or manner thereof; in the former of theſe, unity is required, and is performed moſt axactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Catholiques;</hi> but in the later
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:105178:135"/> (which concernes but the reaſon of that concluſion, which reaſon is for the moſt part reduced to ſome Scholaſticall ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) learned men have in all ages, and may (without breach of unity) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their difference. For although all men be bound to the decree'd point of faith, yet they are not ſo, to the reaſon and manner thereof, unleſſe the ſame alſo be defined by the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hereby are anſwered all the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Protestants</hi> concerning the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of <hi>Catholiques,</hi> as of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> and <hi>Scotists</hi> concerning the <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Lady;</hi> of the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> about the concurrence of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Freewill,</hi> with ſuch like, in which the <hi>Church</hi> hath not yet interpoſed her Decree. And ſome <hi>Protestants</hi> affirm (out of their profound politicall inſight) that ſhe never will; and that becauſe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) ſhe dares not; out of fear to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe ſo mighty a party, as each opinion hath. And yet they know, that the <hi>Church</hi> was not afraid to decree againſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Luther</hi> and his brood, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhe loſt ſome <hi>Kings,</hi> and much people thereby; but the loſſe was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hers, but theirs much more; ſhe loſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:105178:135"/> ſome incurable members, but they loſt themſelves. And doubtleſſe when ſhe ſees it meet to determine any of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies amongſt the learned, ſhee will doe it without any fear, but of God.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we ſee that their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of opinions breed no more diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the <hi>Church,</hi> nor rancor amongſt themſelves, than their different colours and ſhapes of apparrell. Brotherly charity is not violated amongſt them: they will all goe to the ſame Church, they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate together, and confeſſe to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; nor is there any of them but if he be asked, will ſay, that he will ſtand to a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> in any of the points of difference amongſt them, and ſubmit his judgement to hers. But <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have no <hi>Councells,</hi> nor any authority to call a <hi>Councell</hi> out of the extent of their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dominions; the Articles of <hi>Religion</hi> which they have agreed upon apart, are very different one from another, as may be ſeen in their <hi>Harmony of Confeſſions;</hi> nor in the ſame <hi>Dominion</hi> will they ſtand to any determination of <hi>Convocation, Synod,</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> further than it decrees ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God, of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one will be a judge for himfelfe. And
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:105178:136"/> in the mean time they violate brotherly charity, make ſchiſms and ſeparations one from another, refuſe to goe to <hi>Church,</hi> or communicate together, and in defence of their differences, wage war one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. So that their <hi>Harmony of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> may more truly be called <hi>the confuſion of Confeſſions;</hi> and their <hi>Churches,</hi> the <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt unity they have is not in believing, but in not believing; (though therein they are not exact, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before:) their faith (as they call it) being for the moſt part negative, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in denying what <hi>Catholiques</hi> affirme; as denying and not believing the <hi>infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Reall Corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſeven Sacraments, Invocation of Saints, Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Prayer for the dead,</hi> with many other, abating their poſitive faith almoſt to nothing: now not-believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not believing; and their profeſſion and union in the moſt, is not of faith, but of infidelity. And for their poſitive belief, I think it conſiſts in two <hi>Articles</hi> only, <hi>That there is a God,</hi> and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt died for the ſinnes of the world;</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever affirmes more than this, it will be no hard matter to find ſome other <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:105178:136"/> that will deny it: what union then is there amongſt them, but that which was betwixt <hi>Symeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> to be brethren in evill? and in writing the <hi>Articles</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> as <hi>Draco</hi> did his lawes, in blood? For what nation is there, where the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> hath ſettled her foot, where they did not in the ſetling thereof fill their hands with blood? And by <hi>Rebellion</hi> and unutterable cruelties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate (as they thought) the Goſpell of peace? The Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> only excepted, where the change was made by the <hi>Princes.</hi> Which change not having gon far enough from the <hi>Catholique Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> the people, having got the ſword into their hands, doe now attempt (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the patern of all their fellow <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) to make a ſecond <hi>Reformation,</hi> with ſuch witty <hi>Rebellion</hi> and cruelty (the only things wherin they did ever excerciſe any wit) that as no poſterity wilbe able to imitate, ſo no poſterity will keep it ſilent; but blazon it throughout the world, to their eternall infamy; when the <hi>Religion,</hi> their Idoll, to whom they ſacrifice all this humane blood ſhall be ſunk (from whence it came) to hell.</p>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:105178:137"/> ſucceſſion of Prelates ſince the Sea of <hi>Peter</hi> (to whom our Lord conſigned the feeding of his ſheep after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to the preſent Biſhops Sea, retaines me; &amp; finally the very name of <hi>Catholique</hi> retains me, which not without cauſe, this Church alone, amongſt ſo many &amp; ſo great hereſies, hath ſo maintained; as when a ſtranger asks where they aſſemble to communicate in the Catholique Church, there is no heretique that dares ſhew him his own Temple, or his own houſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2.

Firſt that in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church <hi>Miracles</hi> were abſolutly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the planting of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> in the world; <hi>John.</hi> 5.36. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.29.30. and then the gift of <hi>Miracles</hi> was ordinarily annexed to the miniſtry of preaching; ſo that moſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> commonly had that gift in one kind or other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. Secondly that ſince the planting of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> by 12. fiſhermen, which was the <hi>Miracle</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> no further Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is abſolutely neceſſary for men to whom this is known; and therefore the gift of <hi>miracles</hi> is ceaſed to be ordinarily annexed to the office of preaching, or common almoſt to all <hi>Christians,</hi> as before it was. Thirdly notwithſtanding this; in all ages there were, are, and ever ſhal be ſome ſpeciall places and perſons extraordinarily endued with the gift of <hi>Miracles,</hi> for the comfort of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and converſion of remote nations, to whom the ſame of the firſt miraculous planting of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not come: And of Miracles of this kind<note n="c" place="margin">Aug. de. civit lib. <hi>22.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> Greg.

               <p>Laſtly, for confirmation of the <hi>Reall Preſence,</hi> it is reported, that in a town cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Knobloch,</hi> in the year 1510. one <hi>Paul Forme</hi> a Sacrilegious perſon, went ſecretly into the <hi>Church</hi> by night, brake the <hi>Pyx,</hi> and ſtole from thence two conſecrated <hi>Hoſts,</hi> one of which he ſold to a <hi>Jew,</hi> who in diſdainfull malice ſaid, <hi>If thou be the God of Chriſtians manifeſt thy ſelfe;</hi> and thereupon pierced the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with his dagger, whereupon blood did miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow forth.

               </p>
               <p>If I ſhould undertake to ſet down all the <hi>Miracles</hi> that have been done in the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> I might ſay, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did of our <hi>Saviours</hi> doings, that if they were all written, <hi>the whole world could not contain the books, Ioh.</hi> 21.25. To all which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> anſwer, as the <hi>Blaſphemous
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:105178:141"/> Iewes</hi> did to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that they were done by the Devill. To whom <hi>Catholiques</hi> cannot give that anſwer our <hi>Saviour</hi> did, <hi>If I, by Belzebub caſt out Devills, by whom do your children caſt them out? Mat.</hi> 12.27. For your children caſt out none. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I believe that they that do thus accuſe the <hi>Miracles</hi> done by ſo many holy <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique</hi> men and women, would have done the ſame to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> if they had lived in his daies. For <hi>Miracles</hi> being the laſt and higheſt proof of other things, can have no proof for themſelves, but the evidence of ſenſe, to them that ſee them, and their teſtimony and report to others.</p>
               <p>But if (as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay) the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Catholiques</hi> were done by the Devill, how were they <hi>Miracles?</hi> For the Devill can do none, though he can do wonders; &amp; if they were <hi>Miracles,</hi> how were they done by the Devill? Now that they were <hi>Miracles,</hi> many <hi>Protestants</hi> do grant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chillingworth</hi> their Paragon doth alſo confeſs, that they are done by God; whence any reaſonable man would infer, that his next word would be, the profeſſion of himſelf, a <hi>Roman Catholique,</hi> in which Church God works <hi>Miracles,</hi> the laſt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:105178:141"/> and higheſt motive of belief. But inſtead hereof (O the accurſed power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill) he belcheth forth the moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpeech againſt God, that ever ſtruck the tender ſenſe of a pious eare: and ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">In the preface of his book, fine.</note> 
                  <q>that it ſeemes moſt ſtrange to him that God in his juſtice ſhould permit ſome true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be wrought to delude them who have forged ſo many to delude the world.</q> As if God, the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of truth,</hi> would ſet his ſeal, which is <hi>Miracles,</hi> to confirme falſhood, to delude the ſoules of men into ſin, and ſo change titles with the <hi>Devill,</hi> and be the father of lies, and deceiver of mankind: Than which, what can be imagined more helliſh? More true and pious was the ſaying of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and appliable to our workers of <hi>Miracles; we know that thou art a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er come from God, for no man could do theſe miracles that thou dost, except God were with him, John</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>But wee may take up the complaint of the <hi>Prophet</hi> Eſay; <hi>who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed? Eſay</hi> 53.1. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not believe theſe things; and in matter of proof Catholiques can goe no further;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:105178:142"/> our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf did not; ſo that now nothing remaines, but for God to touch their hearts with his grace, and to move them to believe that which they have moſt reaſon to think to be his word: which God of his great mercy grant. And if they conſider it, they ſhall find it the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing in the world to deny <hi>Miracles</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> for that there are and ſhall be <hi>Miracles</hi> in the world no prudent man (I ſuppoſe) will deny, at leaſt for the converſion of the people; Yea we read of many <hi>Miracles</hi> done in the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> amongſt thoſe that were of the true faith, and therefore were not intended for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but for confirmation, or to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end; And why may it not be ſo in the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> Now <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> or any other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> doe not ſo much as pretend to <hi>Miracles,</hi> therfore they that are, are amongſt <hi>Roman Catholiques.</hi> Indeed I have read of <hi>Calvin</hi> that for the credit of his new doctrine, he would make ſhew to the people of doing a <hi>Miracle;</hi> and hired one that was ſick to counterfeit himſelfe dead, who when <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhould ſpeak certain words, was to riſe up, as it were from the dead; but he not ſtirring
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105178:142"/> nor anſwering at his cue, they looked, and found him dead indeed;<note n="b" place="margin">Capcavil. in chronicis Pontificum Leodienſium</note> But on the other ſide, the ſonne of <hi>Calvin</hi> being bit by a mad dog, and his father not able to cure him, he was ſent to S. <hi>Hubert</hi> in <hi>Ardenne,</hi> where the body of that <hi>Saint</hi> is kept with great veneration, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought thereby, and there was he made perfectly whole, and thereupon abjured the Religion, wherein his father brought him up, and became a <hi>Roman Catholique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Now for the <hi>Miracles</hi> that are ſaid to be done in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> we have as high humane Teſtimony as can be imagined; So that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may with as much reaſon deny all humane ſtory, as that there were <hi>Henries</hi> and <hi>Edwards</hi> Kings of <hi>England,</hi> whom they never ſaw; yea they may as juſtly deny or doubt of the truth of their owne names, which they doe not know, but by report, and mens calling them ſo, and the poor record of a <hi>Church-book;</hi> but <hi>Miracles</hi> have much more famous Records, and more people that believe them. And can they prudently i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (but themſelves) ſo ſtupid and fooliſh to believe theſe things
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:105178:143"/> without ſufficient proof? who in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, they muſt (without the help of modeſty) acknowledg more wiſe and learned then themſelves. What did <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> doe more, than the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> hath ſince done? and what can <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay more againſt her, than the unbelieving <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> might ſay againſt them? And becauſe ſome feigned Miracles are ſometimes diſcovered, from thence to charge all with the ſame accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is unjuſt, ſo it is abſurd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroies all humane faith; they may as well deny all that is, or hath been done in the world, whereof they have not been eye-witneſſes, becauſe ſome of thoſe reports have been falſe. Therefore as they believe <hi>Catholiques,</hi> when they ſay ſome were feigned; ſo in juſtice they ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, when they ſay others are not ſo. Otherwiſe by the ſame way of reaſoning, they may ſay that the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> were not true, becauſe the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians</hi> were counterfeit; or that the new Teſtament is not the word of God, becauſe there were many <hi>Goſpells</hi> &amp; <hi>Epiſtles</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited under the names of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And ſurely <hi>Catholiques</hi> would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcover feigned Miracles, if
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:105178:143"/> they were not ſure that ſome were true, but rather by one act condemn all that have been ſince the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that are, or ſhall be, for falſe and counterfeit, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in effect doe, when they ſay, that <hi>Miracles</hi> are ceaſed.</p>
               <p>Moreover to affirme that <hi>Miracles</hi> are <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> as ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe, is improper; firſt becauſe it is yet in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betwixt us, whether <hi>Antichriſt</hi> be come or no, which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have not proved, nor never will with reference to the <hi>Pope.</hi> Secondly it is granted on both ſides, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall doe no <hi>Miracles</hi> properly, but only ſome ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; not exceeding the power of nature and the devills art; whereof one is <hi>to cauſe fire to come down from heaven, Apoc.</hi> 13.13. which never any <hi>Pope</hi> did; but the <hi>Miracles</hi> done in the <hi>Church</hi> doe exceed all created power. And laſtly many <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> were done in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time or times, (for they agree not in their reckoning) that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay <hi>Antichriſt</hi> did firſt appear; as at the reliques of<note n="d" place="margin">Chryſoſt. in lib. cont.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proves it to be falſe; ſecondly if it were true, yet it is of no moment to prove the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any other Religion but the <hi>Roman Catholique,</hi> for the converting of nations, and the fulfilling of the large <hi>Propheſies</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> therein; ſeeing they that are pretended to be converted by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> were but the leſſer part of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> moſt of them having been <hi>Catholiques</hi> before. Thirdly this example doth rather make for the <hi>Roman faith,</hi> in that of all the world converted to <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> there is but one poor half example of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:105178:145"/> (and that falſe too) wrought by any other <hi>Religion.</hi> Which when it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that this pretended converſion was wrought by <hi>Arrians,</hi> who (even in the opinion of moſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) were <hi>Heretiques,</hi> it will turne to the ſhame and reproach of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who pretending to be the true <hi>Religion,</hi> cannot ſhew ſo much.</p>
               <p>As for their affirming of converting ſome to their faith, who before were <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,</hi> it is impertinent, for ſo any <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques,</hi> that ever were, and had the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſucceſſe (as ſome have had) of drawing any <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Kingdome</hi> to their <hi>Hereſie,</hi> might ſay, that they converted them; ſo that by the mark thus placed, the true <hi>Church</hi> could not be diſcerned from the falſe. That therfore which doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them, is the Converſion of <hi>Heathen,</hi> which hath been performed throughout the world, by <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> only.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. ANother <hi>Mark</hi> of the true <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>holineſſe of doctrine;</hi> of which our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith <hi>Math.</hi> 7.13.14. <hi>Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leades to life: and wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to deſtruction.</hi> Now it is evident by the known doctrine of the <hi>Roman Catholique Church,</hi> that the way through which ſhee directs her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is very ſtrait and narrow. Shee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns <hi>Confeſſion of ſinnes</hi> not only to God, but to his <hi>Priest:</hi> alſo; not only <hi>Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and ſorrow for ſinne, but alſo <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> by doing of <hi>Penance,</hi> and reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of reall damages done to our neighbours. Shee obliges to ſet times of faſting &amp; prayer, &amp; magnifies the merit of good works; propounding alſo and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the ſublimer acts of voluntary Poverty, Chaſtity, and Obedience, and the excerciſing of other great acts of auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the ſubduing of ſinne in the fleſh, and to expreſſe our love to Chriſt who
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:105178:147"/> ſuffered ſo much for us: And to this end hath ſet forth a world of books of admirable devotion, and direction of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment of a mans life to holineſſe, and height of purity.</p>
               <p>On the contrary look upon the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> and we find a wide gate of liberty ſet open, through which every one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally delights to paſſe. They deny <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Purgatory,</hi> or any Satisfaction for the temporall puniſhment due to ſinne, after it is remitted by Contrition; as alſo all merit of workes, whereby they make all faſting, prayers, mortifications, and good works uſeleſſe, and quench the fear of committing ſin; for out of doubt, next to the pure love of God, and fear to Hell, the fear of temporall puniſhment, and the Confeſſion of our ſinnes to men, are the greateſt reſtrainers of vice. They teach that chaſtity is not in our power, co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with Gods grace;<note n="a" place="margin">Luther to. <hi>5.</hi> wit. Serm. de matrim. fol. <hi>119.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <q>that it is not in our power to be without a woman, &amp;c. it is not in their power that it ſhould be ſtaied or omitted; but is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as to eat, drink, purge, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now what a flood-gate of liberty doth this ſet open to young men and maids,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:105178:148"/> yea to all ſingle perſons, who have not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day the oportunity of Marriage; as alſo to all married people in the abſence or infirmity one of another? For who (if he be taught that he cannot abſtain) will ſtrive to reach at an impoſſibility?</p>
               <p>Againe, they teach that the <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi> are impoſſible to be kept; and this ordinarily ſlackens all indeavours to that end. That men are juſtified by faith only; which uſhers in the neglect of all good works. That men have not free will, no not by the grace of God; and this makes all exhortations to vertue, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions from vice fruitleſſe in them. And that all that are ſaved are aſſured thereof in this life, than which, what greater temptation to preſumption and the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinning? And if there be any in whom theſe principles do not take this effect, it is not becauſe the doctrines do not afford it, but becauſe they are reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome other motives.</p>
               <p>Therefore Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> (in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſect.</hi> 48.) ſaith, <q>Let the Proteſtants look with the eye of charity upon them of the Papacy, as well as of ſeverity, and they ſhall find ſome excellent orders of government, ſome ſingular helps for the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:105178:148"/> increaſe of godlineſſe and devotion, for the conquering of ſin, for the profiting in vertue: and contrariwiſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, looking with a more ſingle and leſſe indulgent eye, they ſhall find there is no ſuch abſolute perfection in their Doctrine and Reformation: yea to ſpeak more truly and fully, they ſhall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but imperfection.</q>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:105178:155"/> and erected a new <hi>Church</hi> to themſelves; As S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>in Ep.

But certain it is, that this cannot be proved, ſeeing ſhe was planted by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and never ſeparated her ſelf from any precedent <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true indeed that there were <hi>Churches</hi> elder than ſhe in time, as ſhe is a particular <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> where the <hi>Goſpell</hi> was firſt preached, and of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> where S. <hi>Peter</hi> was firſt <hi>Biſhop,</hi> with other <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but theſe all agreed in the unity of Faith,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:105178:156"/> and were all ſubject to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> after it was planted, in union under the head thereof S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors, as I ſhall ſhew by and by. And the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> did never ſeperate from any of theſe, but many of theſe from her, in the Hereſie of <hi>Arius</hi> and others, as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> will not deny. If then ſhe did never ſeparate from any elder <hi>Church,</hi> ſo that men might ſay here is a <hi>Church,</hi> and there is the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> once the ſame with her, and now ſeparated from her, ſhe muſt ſtill be the firſt and true <hi>Church,</hi> or there is none upon earth.</p>
               <p>But certain it is on the contrary ſide, that all the former <hi>Churches,</hi> which <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> themſelves will call <hi>Heretiques,</hi> as <hi>Arrians, Macedonians, Nestorians, Enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians, Donatiſts,</hi> with many others, did ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhe can tell when, and why; and no leſſe certain is it, that all that are now called <hi>Protestants,</hi> and all the pedigree of their fore-fathers, <hi>Waldo, Wickliffe, Huſſe, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin,</hi> and all the Kingdomes wherein their followers are, were once, and firſt of the <hi>Roman Catholique Church,</hi> and have forſaken her Communion and departed from her, and have not joyned

               <p>Nor is it a denyall of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the Head, while we ſay, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was, and the <hi>Pope is</hi> ſo.

S. <hi>Baſil (Concione de poenit.)</hi> ſhewes us the difference of their headſhips: <q>Though Peter be a rock (ſaith he) he is not a rock, as Chriſt is; for Chriſt is the true immovable rock of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Peter is immoveable by Chriſt the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:105178:158"/> rock, for <hi>Jeſus</hi> doth communicate and impart his dignities not voiding himſelfe of them; but holding them to himſelfe, beſtowes them alſo on others: He is the light, and yet you are the lights; He is the Prieſt, and yet he makes Prieſts; He is the Rock, and he made a rock.</q> Therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith to Peter, (<hi>Math.</hi> 16.18.19.) <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it.</hi> And, <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind upon earth ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it contrary to this (as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> imagine) to ſay (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſometimes doe) that the <hi>Church</hi> was built upon the confeſſion of <hi>Peter,</hi> theſe two expoſitions not excluding, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding one another. For they intend that the <hi>Church</hi> was built cauſally on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Peter,</hi> and formally on the miniſtry of the Perſon of <hi>Peter;</hi> that is to ſay the confeſſion of <hi>Peter</hi> was the cauſe wherefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> choſe him, to conſtitute him the foundation of the miniſtry of the <hi>Church:</hi> and that the perſon of S. <hi>Peter</hi> was that, on which our Lord did properly build

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:105178:163"/> that all <hi>Biſhops</hi> were true <hi>Biſhops,</hi> Miniſters and officers of <hi>Christ,</hi> although concerning jurisdiction, they were ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate the one to the other.

               <p>And in this ſenſe S. <hi>Gregory</hi> withſtood the title of <hi>univerſall Biſhop,</hi> and not to deny (in caſe of jurisdiction) the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of one <hi>Biſhop</hi> over another, and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> over all: For that he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines (<hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>ind.</hi> 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> 62.) ſaying, <q>If there be any crime found in Biſhops, I know no Biſhop but is ſubject to the Sea Apoſtolique.</q> He alſo addes for explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter in hand, (<hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ind.</hi> 13. <hi>Ep.</hi> 32.) that <q>The care of the Church hath been committed to the holy Apoſtle, and Prince of all the Apoſtles, S. <hi>Peter;</hi> the care and Principality hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, and yet he is not called u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Apoſtle.

               <p>Moreover the Hiſtories of all ages beat record, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed authority over all other <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the world, even in all Forraign Nations, (both before S. <hi>Gregory</hi> and after, and even in his perſon, and therefore he cannot mean the univerſall Government, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the title of <hi>univerſall Biſhop;</hi>) as by creating them himſelf; by confirming them, created by others; by depoſing them, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring them, being depoſed by others; by appointing them his Vicars, by finall deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their controverſies; by accepting their Appeales; by making Lawes over all the

AFter all theſe fore-going conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, for my more explicite ſatisfaction, I deſcended to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the particular Doctrines in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> whom I found in all things to be exceedingly over-weighed both by <hi>Scripture, Councells, Fathers,</hi> and reaſon. Of which I will ſay no more than I have done, but onely to ſhew in ſome few particulars, how our poore <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh people</hi> are abuſed by their ordinary <hi>Preachers,</hi> and made to believe monſtrous things of the Doctrine and practice of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> who for the moſt part ſtating the queſtion falſe, and laying to the <hi>Catholiques</hi> charge the things that they do not teach, raiſe an error out of their own fancy, and then fight againſt it moſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly, under the title of <hi>Popery.</hi> And
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:105178:166"/> every young <hi>Miniſter</hi> is ſo valiant herein, that he thinks he baffles the moſt learned <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> as <hi>Goliah</hi> thought he could have done <hi>David;</hi> and in this caſe for the moſt part the moſt ignorant and imprudent are the forwardeſt. And this I add to rectifie the opinions of the leſſe learned, and to reconcile them ſo far to the <hi>Catholique doctrines,</hi> as to believe they are not ſo monſtrous as they are vulgarly imagined.</p>
               <p>Firſt then they tell the people that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (as they call them) are <hi>Idolaters,</hi> in that they worſhip Images, ſtockes, and ſtones, little painted babies and puppets, with many ſuch like titles, wherewith they make themſelves merry; and then alledge all the places of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Fathers,</hi> wherein the Idolatry of the Heathen is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Now it is moſt certain that this is an unjuſt charge againſt <hi>Catholiques;</hi> firſt becauſe the worſhip of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls</hi> is not all one, ſeeing the words are of different ſignification, as is manifeſt by thoſe places where it is ſaid, <hi>Let us make man after our Image,</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26.) <hi>And a man ought not to cover his head, becauſe he is the image and glory of God.</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7.) with many the like; wherein if they ſay
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:105178:166"/> that <hi>Image</hi> &amp; <hi>Idoll</hi> were all one, they muſt ſay alſo that when God made <hi>Adam,</hi> hee made to himſelfe an <hi>Idoll.</hi> Secondly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi> doe not worſhip <hi>Images,</hi> as God, which the <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Jewes,</hi> when they had committed Idolatry, did, as appears by <hi>Elias</hi> who ſaith unto them, 3. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. <hi>If the Lord be God, follow him, if Baal be God, follow him;</hi> cleerly intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that they that followed <hi>Baal,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worſhipped him as God. Thirdly it is only the worſhip of <hi>Images</hi> for God, which is by God forbidden, as appears, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.23. where it is ſaid, <hi>you ſhall not make to your ſelves Gods of ſilver and Gods of gold,</hi> and <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.1. <hi>you ſhall make no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls and graven Images, &amp;c. to bow downe therto, for I am the Lord, and my glory I will not give to another, neither my praiſe to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven images, Eſay</hi> 24.8.</p>
               <p>By which places (as by all other) is forbidden that kind of bowing, honour, and worſhip which is due to God only, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> therfore I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages are not; and <hi>my praiſe and my glory I will not give to another,</hi> that is, that praiſe and glory which is due to me only; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (ſeeing man is another thing from God) it would be unlawfull to give
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:105178:167"/> any kind of praiſe, or bow down to men, which no body I think will affirme. This and this only, is properly <hi>Idolatry;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to worſhip a creature, believing it to be God, and giving to it the divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable attributes, and in that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to exerciſe devotion to it; which is far from the belief or practiſe of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</hi> But that holy creatures, as <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angells</hi> are to be worſhipped, with ſuch worſhip as we give to perſons of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall qualities here on earth, as bowing and kneeling; or ſuch as we give to all whoſe help we deſire, as praying; and theſe (in the abſence of the parties) by and through their Images; and that the Images themſelves are to be reverently handled for their ſakes, whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, no rationall man can deny.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. And whereas many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſtumble at the word <hi>worſhip,</hi> and think that it imports a thing that is to be done to God only, they are therein miſtaken; <hi>worſhip</hi> ſignifying any kind of reverence and reſpect either of body or mind; and is communicable to all creatures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their dignity: therefore in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Phraſe</hi> we call all eminent Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>worſhipfull,</hi> that is, men that deſerve
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:105178:167"/> reverence or worſhip; and all men do worſhip others, when they put off their hats, or bow their bodies to them. And whereas they ſay, it is but civill worſhip which they give to men, it is impertinent; for civill and religious worſhip do not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the outward act or expreſſion, but in the object that is worſhipped; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civill worſhip which is given to a civil perſon or thing, which is religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, being directed to a holy perſon or thing. Now <hi>Saints,</hi> being holy perſons, their <hi>Images</hi> or other things that belong to them may be ſaid to be holy; firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have relation to them; as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>put off thy ſhooes from thy feet; for the place where thou ſtandest is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground, Exod.</hi> 3.5. which was in regard of the preſence of the <hi>Angells</hi> by whom the Law was delivered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. Secondly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Images</hi> are dedicated to honour God withall, by and through them whom they repreſent, of which the Scripture ſaith, <hi>whatſoever ſhall once be conſecrated, ſhall be moſt holy to the Lord, Levit.</hi> 27.28. for which cauſe all the <hi>Veſtments</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils</hi> of the <hi>Temples</hi> were called holy; therefore the reverence and reſpect done to <hi>Images</hi> is and ought to be holy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:105178:168"/> worſhip; for whatſoever is holy, is religiouſly honourable or worſhipfull, and that ſo far, and in that ſenſe that it is holy; and ſo are Images of religious perſons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent (Seſſ.</hi> 25. <hi>decret. de Sanct. Imag.</hi>) hath expreſſed the doctrine of the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> herein, in theſe words, <q>The Image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mother of God, and of other Saints are to be had and retained, eſpecially in Churches; and due honour and worſhip is to be imparted to them; not for that any Divinity is to be believed to be in them, or vertue for which they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; or that any thing is to be beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of them, or that hope is to be put in them, as in times paſt the Pagans did, who put their truſt in Idolls; but becauſe the honour which is exhibited to them, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the firſt pattern, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. So that by the Images which we kiſſe, and before whom we uncover our heads and kneel, we adore Chriſt and his Saints, whoſe likeneſſe they beare.</q> Whatſoever is more than this, are but School-points, which no man is bound to believe further than his particular reaſon guides him.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:105178:168"/>
               <p>But howſoever the belief is (ſay the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) yet the practiſe is otherwiſe, and ſome ignorant people doe pray to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> believing them to be very God, and ſo ſeek ſuccour from them, as from God; and it is better (ſay they) that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images ſhould be aboliſhed, than that it ſhould be the occaſion of Idolatry. Their affirmation as it is not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, conſidering the plentifull meanes of inſtruction in all places, and the eaſineſſe of the thing to be apprehended, ſo their inference is falſe; for (paſſing by their preferring their own judgement herein, before all the world of <hi>Catholiques,</hi> which objection lies againſt them in all that they ſay, and is a great one) I anſwer, the good uſe of a thing is not to be taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the abuſe, eſpecially when the good uſe is very abundant, and the abuſe very rare, and eaſily amended by inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; otherwiſe all good things muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, becauſe by ſome or other they are abuſed. Theſe men that argue thus, wil not ſay that wine is to be deſtroyed, becauſe ſome men are drunk therewith; or the uſe of ſwords forbidden, becauſe ſome men commit murder with them; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, that the reading of the <hi>Bible</hi> ſhould is
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:105178:169"/> be prohibited, becauſe ſome men pervert it (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith) to their own damnation. The uſe of <hi>Jmages</hi> then (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this objection) is lawfull, and unfit to be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>Nor truly can any man, whoſe naturall underſtanding is not corrupted by his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of <hi>Scripture,</hi> boggle at it. It is a Principle in nature, gathered out of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> IDEM EST MOTUS IN IMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINEM ET EXEMPLAR, that the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage may and ought to ſtand for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe image it is, and is by imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be taken as if it were the perſon, and what we doe to the Image, is done by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to the perſon. And this is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Prophet David</hi> ſaying, <hi>Adore his footſtoole,</hi> (which the <hi>Proteſtants of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> falſly tranſlate <hi>at his footſtool) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is holy, Pſal.</hi> 98.5. God appointed that the Tabernacle ſhould be taken by i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination for his houſe, the Mercy-ſeat for his Throne, and the Ark for his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, and ſo he imagined there preſent, as ſitting with his feet on the Ark; and this ordination being ſuppoſed, the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>Adore his footſtool;</hi> yet taking of the Ark, as a place where God is preſent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> but a poſitive ordinance (whereas Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:105178:169"/> by the law of nature ſtand for thoſe whoſe images they are) yet this poſitive ordinance ſuppoſed, the law of nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo binds men to worſhip and adore it, with reference to God, imagined to ſit thereon.</p>
               <p>This ever hath been and is the opinion and practiſe of all the world, except it be of thoſe who under the ſhew of grace have extinguiſhed the light of nature, and yet even theſe in their humane practiſes doe the ſame things; as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Saints</hi> were the only men that after death or in abſence were incapable of honour. It is well known that the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queenes</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are honoured by uncovering of the head in all places, where they are but ſuppoſed to be preſent; and when they are dead, untill their funeralls are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, there is the ſame reſpect exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to their Images as to themſelves. And what <hi>Puritane lover</hi> is there that will not in the ardour of his affection, kiſſe, lay in his boſome, and talk to, not only the picture (which doth more immediately and directly repreſent a perſon, than any thing elſe) but even the handkercher, glove, or letter, which are but reliques of her whom he deſires in marriage? And is
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:105178:170"/> it leſſe Idolatry to doe theſe things to mortall men than to immortall <hi>Saints,</hi> though there be as much difference obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the degree of honour, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the dignity of the perſons? Surely if they conſider it duely, they will find that they muſt either leave their religion in this point, or their manners and civility in all points, ſeeing either both or neither are <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Secondly they teach the people, and the people ordinarily believe, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi> think to be ſaved by their good workes, and that without being beholding to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> For they make an oppoſition between theſe two aſſertions; wee are ſaved by <hi>Chriſts</hi> merits; And we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by our own merits: Hence they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Catholiques</hi> are the proudeſt and moſt ungratefull to God of all people in the world. But this doctrine is miſliked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, becauſe it is miſunderſtood.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Catholiques</hi> hold that no work is meritorious with God of its owne nature; but to make the ſame meritorious many graces are required. Firſt the grace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> whereby ſoules are ſupernaturally beautified by participation of the divine nature, whence a triple dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:105178:170"/> redounds to works: One from <hi>God the Father,</hi> who in reſpect of adoption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards good works, as the works of his children: Another from <hi>God the holy Ghoſt</hi> dwelling in us, by whom good works are honoured, as by the principall author of them; ſo that he rather then wee, doth the works: Thirdly they receive dignity from <hi>God the Sonne,</hi> whoſe members we are made by grace, which grace he by his merits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us, ſo that the works we doe, are reputed not ſo much ours, or his; as the work of a particular member is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted principally to the head. Secondly there is required grace prevenient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God ſtirres up mens hearts to pious workes; and grace adjuvant to aſſiſt us in the performancee of the works, making our free-will produce works that are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall; and above the reach of meer man. Thirdly there is required the grace of mercifull indulgence, in not uſing us in the rigour of his juſtice; for God might require the good works we doe, as his own by many titles: as by the title of juſtice, being the works of his ſervants and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; by the title of religion, as being the works of his creatures; by the title of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as being the works of perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105178:171"/> obliged to him; by which titles if God did exact upon works with utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rigour, no goodneſſe would be left in them to be offered for meriting of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; But his infinite benignity remitting this rigour, moved thereunto through the merits of <hi>Christ,</hi> is content that wee make uſe of our good works for the purchaſing of glory, and doth not exact them as wholely due by all his titles. The fourth is the favour of Gods liberall promiſe, by which he obligeth himſelfe to reward the good works of his children according to the meaſure of their goodneſſe, without which the moſt excellent works of <hi>Saints</hi> could not eſtabliſh an obligation on him. And finally there is required the grace of perſeverance, without which no man is crowned.</p>
               <p>And ſo far are <hi>Catholiques</hi> from boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or truſting in their <hi>merits,</hi> that the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent (Seſſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Can.</hi> 16.) faith, <hi>God forbid that a Chriſtian ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boast or truſt in himſelf, and not in our Lord, whoſe goodneſſe is ſo great towards all men, as that thoſe things which are his gifts, he will have to be our merits.</hi> To be worthy of a thing, to deſerve or merit it, ſignifie
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:105178:171"/> all one; and that by our works we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and are worthy of heaven, is the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent phraſe of Scripture: <hi>The workeman is worthy of his hire,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Saviour; Luke</hi> 10.7. And S. <hi>Paul, That you may be counted worthy of the Kingdome of God; for which alſo ye ſuffer,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. And again, <hi>That you may walk worthy of God, in all things pleaſing, fructifying in all Good works, Coloſ.</hi> 1.10. And our Saviour, <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy, Revel.</hi> 3.4. And againe, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father poſſeſſe the kingdome &amp;c. for I was hungry and ye gave me meat &amp;c. Math.</hi> 25.34. alledging theſe as the cauſe why God received them into everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; with plenty of other places to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As for the moſt frequently objected place of <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.10. <hi>when you have done all thoſe things that are commanded you, ſay we are unprofitable ſervants, we have done that which was our duty to do;</hi> According to S. <hi>Ambroſe (lib.</hi> 8. <hi>in Luc.) Christ</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands hereby to acknowledge what we are of our ſelves, to wit, unprofitable, not what we are by his grace, for that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; according to the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If any man therefore ſhall cleanſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:105178:172"/> from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſell unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſanctified and profitable to our Lord, prepared to every good work;</hi> according to S. <hi>Auguſtine, (Serm.</hi> 3. <hi>de verb. Dom.</hi>) we may be ſaid to be unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, becauſe in doing all that is commanded, we do but our duty, we are Gods ſervants and ſlaves, and owe him all, nor could we look for reward had he not voluntarily covenanted with us. And to this baſe and poor condition of ours, for the preſervation of our humility, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe words ſends back our thoughts: which hinders not, but that (ſuppoſing Gods bountifull promiſe and covenant) we may through his grace truly merit and expect reward; himſelf ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.14. <hi>Didſt thou not covenant with me for a penny? take that which is thine own, and go thy way.</hi> S. Chryſoſtome obſerves, that <hi>Christ</hi> ſaith not, <hi>you are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> but bids them to ſay, they are; willing us thereby, after our good deeds, to think humbly, leſt they be corrupted with pride; for that otherwiſe they only that work evill are by God accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but they that do good, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21. <hi>well done good and faithfull ſervant, becauſe thou

               <p n="4">§. 4. Thirdly many <hi>Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> teach, and the people ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Catholiques</hi> hold that there is nothing required to the remiſſion of ſins, but only to confeſſe them to a Prieſt, and the buſineſſe is done. Whereas indeed they teach, that not only Confeſſion to a <hi>Priest,</hi> but alſo Contrition and ſorrow for their ſinnes, (which is all that <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> require,) as alſo Satisfaction for the temporall puniſhment due to ſin, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and ſo make it a matter of far greater paine than the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it for the eaſineſſe thereof. Now all theſe parts of Penance are plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Scripture;</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith to the Prieſts, <hi>whoſe ſinnes ye ſhall forgive, they are forgiven, and whoſe ſinnes ye ſhall retain, they are retained, Joh.</hi> 20.23. and S. <hi>James</hi> bids us <hi>confeſſe our ſins one to another, Jam.</hi> 5.16. and if to another, to whom but to him that hath power to forgive?</p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:105178:173"/>
               <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> did object againſt our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> as <hi>Protestants</hi> do now againſt <hi>Prieſts,</hi> ſaying, <hi>who can forgive ſinnes, but God only? Mark</hi> 2.7. which error of theirs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, he miraculouſly cured the man ſick of the Palſie, <hi>That ye may know the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive ſinnes,</hi> as our Saviour faith to them; which had been no croſſing of their erroneous conceipt, as the word <hi>[But]</hi> doth intimate it was, unleſſe he had pardoned him, as man, with Commiſſion from God, and not as God immediate; for otherwiſe he ſhould have ſaid, why, I am God, and ſo I pardon him, but he did it as man, doubtleſſe with dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from God; as another <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> expreſſeth it, ſaying, <hi>that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude glorified God, which had given ſuch power to men, Mat.</hi> 9.8.</p>
               <p>Nor need the ſimpleſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that men ſhould forgive ſinnes, ſeeing <hi>Catholiques</hi> teach that they do it not by their own power, but by power given them from God; to whom it belongs originally and by his own power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins, and to them but derivatively and miniſterially from him. So it is ſaid, <hi>that God only doth wondrous things, Pſal.</hi> 72.18. and yet we read in <hi>Scripture</hi> of many men
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:105178:173"/> that wrought <hi>Miracles,</hi> 3 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.39. So it is ſaid, that <hi>God only knowes the hearts of men,</hi> 4 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.16. and yet we read of others that knew the ſecrets of the heart. Nor can this forgiveneſſe of ſinnes (the power whereof God hath given to men) be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of power only to declare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe (as <hi>Protestants</hi> would have it) for this a child, or an Infidell may do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as any other; they may tell them that if they repent God will forgive them; nor needed ſuch a power as this onely, be uſhered by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on them and ſaying, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, Joh.</hi> 20.22. nor by theſe words, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo I ſend you;</hi> for ſurely his Father ſent him to do more than barely to declare and tell them they were forgiven if they repented; and our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhould have changed the form of his words, and not have ſaid, whoſe ſinnes ye remit they are remitted; but whoſe ſins ye remit, they were remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before by God.</p>
               <p>And that this power ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> if it be taken for abſolute power of forgiveneſſe, (as ſome: <hi>Proteſtants</hi> affirme) is unreaſonable; For ſeeing the reaſon and uſe of it, which
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:105178:174"/> is to reconcile God and man together, after mans offending him by ſin, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the worlds end, therefore to the worlds end is committed to them <hi>the Miniſtry of reconciliation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. 19.20. For this power of forgiving ſinnes, was not given to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular priviledge wherewith to dignifie their perſons above other <hi>Prieſts,</hi> but for the uſe and benefit of <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> which will alwaies in this world ſtand in need thereof, &amp; therefore doth he in their Succeſſors alwaies continue the power.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. As for <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> which <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> are taught to believe is needleſſe; it is plaine in <hi>Scripture;</hi> as firſt, that after the ſin is pardoned, which is in regard of our reconciliation to God, and freedome from eternall puniſhment, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines a lyableneſſe to temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as appears in <hi>David,</hi> whom after he had repented; and God pardoned his ſinnes, yet he puniſhed one ſin with the death of his child, another with three daies peſtilence, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.13.14. &amp; 24.10, 12, 13. Nor can this puniſhment be only for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition &amp; not of juſtice, ſeeing the Text ſaith it was, <hi>becauſe he had made the enemies of God to blaſpheme. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> died
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:105178:174"/> both in Gods favour, yet were puniſhed with death before they entred into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for their offence at <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah;</hi> now where death is the puniſhment, it cannot be intended for their admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and amendment in time to come, but as a ſcourge for their offences. And the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſaith plainely, <hi>Thou forgaveſt their ſins and didſt puniſh their inventions; Pſal.</hi> 98.8. If he forgave them, why did he puniſh them? If he did puniſh them, how did he forgive them? He forgave the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall puniſhment, and inflicted the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. Alſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>whom ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give any thing, I forgive alſo; for if I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave any thing, to whom I forgaue it, for your ſakes forgave I it, in the perſon of Chriſt:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. Which words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not concerne the remiſſion of the fault, ſeeing that was pardoned before by the parties great ſorrow, mentioned in the 7. verſe, but muſt be meant of the temporall puniſhment, which was impoſed in the name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This truth <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not deny, nor <hi>Beza</hi> upon this place, who ſaith, that the abatement of this rigour was afterwards called Indulgence.</p>
               <p>And wherefore (I wonder) do <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> when they would divert ſome
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:105178:175"/> preſent or near approaching danger, faſt, and pray, and preach, and give almes, (when yet by their contrition they think their ſinnes forgiven,) if they did not hope by theſe meanes to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their temporall evills, which in their prayers they confeſſe to be inflicted for their ſinnes? Thus doth the force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon drive them to the practiſe of that, which out of oppoſition to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> in their doctrine they contradict. And though <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſatisfaction was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all the puniſhment due to our ſinnes, yet if he hath appointed that we ſhall alſo ſatisfie, as knowing it in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome a thing moſt meet, who ſhall gainſay it? His praiers alſo and his obedience was ſufficient to obtain heaven for us, ſhall we therefore neither pray nor obey? You will ſay we ſhall, becauſe we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; ſo alſo are we commanded to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, as the <hi>Prophet Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>Redeem, thy ſinnes with almes, and thine iniquities with mercy towards the poore, Dan.</hi> 4.24. which Text to avoid, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe corrupt. Now to redeem ſinnes is the ſame in effect as to ſatisfie for them, for how is any thing redeemed, but by ſatisfying the price of its redemption? Why then ſhould
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:105178:175"/> 
                  <hi>Protestants</hi> (under the pretence of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the operation of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſatisfaction, without our concurrence, which <hi>Catholikes</hi> yet acknowledge to proceed from him) diſobey him, and leave him thereby the leſſe ſatisfied with us? But this was <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> moſt acceptable way to fleſh and blood, to caſt all the burden on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and leave nothing to themſelves, but the pleaſing liberty of ſin, which though it ſhould infinitely extend it ſelf, needs no other cure amongſt them, but only their barren faith.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Againe, <hi>Protestants</hi> are taught to believe that to entreat Gods favour by the merits of <hi>Saints</hi> (as <hi>Catholiques</hi> doe) is a great derogation from the merits of <hi>Christ.</hi> But why? <hi>Catholiques</hi> doe not deny, but that the merits of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are of infinite value, and there is motive enough in them for God to beſtow all favour on us; yet ſeeing the <hi>Saints</hi> have merited of God, it is lawfull alſo to entreat him by thoſe merits; and what he doth ſometimes doe and not by Miracle, it is lawfull at any time to entreat him to doe: Now he did bleſſe the houſe of <hi>Potiphar</hi> for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> ſake, therefore doubtleſſe it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for <hi>Potiphar</hi> to intreat God to bleſſe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:105178:176"/> him for <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſake; and if ſo, then much more for the ſake of <hi>Saints</hi> in heaven, who are more in Gods favour, then <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> could be here in this life. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> deſires God to aſſwage his wrath againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Remember Abraham Iſaac, and Iſrael thy ſervants; Exod.</hi> 32.13. and for what ſhould he remember them but for the good works and ſervice they had done? and for that to ſpare their children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvins</hi> ſhift in anſwer to this and the like places is trifling, when he ſaith that God is only entreated to remember his <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> whereby he promiſed to bleſſe their poſterity; for there is mention not only of Gods <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> but of the righteouſneſſe and merits of the <hi>Saints. Salomon</hi> praies thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1. <hi>Lord remember David and all his meekneſſe,</hi> his afflictions, as the <hi>Protestants</hi> read it, which is all one for our preſent purpoſe, both being meritorious; and a little after he ſaith, <hi>For thy ſervant Davids ſake turn not away the face of thine anointed;</hi> where God is invocated by the merits of <hi>David,</hi> who was dead and gone: and God likewiſe for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake did hear and proſper <hi>Abia,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:105178:176"/> 
                  <hi>For Davids ſake did our Lord his God give him a lamp in Jeruſalem, that he might raiſe up his ſon after him, and eſtabliſh Ieruſalem, becauſe David had done right in the eyes of the Lord,</hi> 3. <hi>Kings</hi> 15.4.5. Much more is found in Scripture to this purpoſe. Nor can it be a derogation from the merits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe value, as it is infinite in it ſelfe, ſo it gives all the tincture to all the merits of all <hi>Saints;</hi> like the <hi>Elixer,</hi> which turnes all into gold, that it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; And like the radiant Sun enkindles all other celeſtiall fires; yea ſo far is it from being a diſhonour to him, that it adds to him a great encreaſe of honour; by being able to raiſe his ſervants to ſuch a pitch of excellency, that they can merit favours both for themſelves and others.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Againe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are taught to believe that it is an arrogant thing to think that a man may doe more than he is commanded, (as <hi>Catholiques</hi> teach) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they think he cannot do ſo much. Yet what more plaine in <hi>Scriptures?</hi> What more evident in reaſon? That wee are commanded to give almes is true, but the proportion is not expreſt; let a man give ſo much dayly, as that he may juſtly think he hath diſcharged his duty, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:105178:177"/> ſinnes not, though he give no more; and then may he give more, and ſo do more then he is commanded. Suppoſe a man bound to faſt and pray in ſuch or ſuch a meaſure, which when he hath done, he hath diſcharged the duty of a Chriſtian; yet when this is done, he may take ſome of the time wherein he may lawfully feed and recreate himſelf, and beſtow this alſo in faſting and prayer; doth not he in this doe more, than he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? I think no impartiall man will ſay the contrary: Elſe there were no compaſſe or latitude of goodneſſe wherein men might move, excelling one another in degrees, yet the loweſt void of ſinne: Elſe he that were not moſt good muſt be evill; there would be no <hi>medium</hi> betwixt ſin and excellency; And men that were deſirous to pleaſe God would abound in ſcruples that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſatisfied; it being impoſſible in every mans condition, to find out that indiviſible point of prayer, faſting, almes, and the like, beyond or ſhort of which, he muſt be guilty of ſin.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>There are Eunuchs, who have made themſelves Eunuchs for the Kingdome of heaven, Mat.</hi> 19.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:105178:177"/> this is more than any man is bound to, for he may marry if he will, and yet go to heaven. He ſaith again, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell all that thou haſt, and give it to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven.</hi> No man can reaſonably ſuppoſe this to be a command, for then all men were bound to obey it; and if not, than he that obeyes it, doth more than he is commanded. And to think that this was a perſonall command to this man only (as many do) is ridiculous; our <hi>Saviour</hi> had ſpoke of the Commandements before, which when the young man ſaid he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives him this counſel of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> immediately after affirmed, that they had obſerved it, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things to follow him. <hi>Concerning Virgins</hi> (ſaith the Appoſtle) <hi>I have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but I give counſell,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25. plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhing betwixt counſell &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; betwixt that we muſt do, and what we may do; betwixt well &amp; better, <hi>He that marries doth well, but he that marries not, doth better,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.38. and he that doth well, doth not ſin, doth not break a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but he that doth better, doth more than not ſin, doth more than he is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And though it be harder indeed to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:105178:178"/> do all that is commanded, than in ſome degrees to do more than is commanded; yet the higheſt degrees of acts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and things uncommanded, are harder than the higheſt of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; yet neither impoſſible by the grace of God, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am able to do all things through him that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth me, Phil.</hi> 4.13. So that the doctrine of doing more than is commanded, is not ſo fraught with pride, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> imagine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catholiques</hi> ſay, that God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us all the good that he inables us to do, as is proved; and this is the ground of works of ſupererogation, and doing more than is commanded: <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay that God requires of us all that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to do, yea and more, commanding things impoſſible, and then puniſhes us for not doing them, which is moſt tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall. Now if God do not require all, but only thus much, to do well; then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better than well, is a ſtock which God of his great bounty gives us to improve for our ſelves in a higher meaſure, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him liberalities, beyond the bond of duty. And what pride is it for man to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this ſweet providence of his creator, &amp; to praiſe his merciful indulgence
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:105178:178"/> in not exacting ſo much as he might, but giving him a way &amp; means to ſhew his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary &amp; unexacted love to him? Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing that this divine favour (not to exact the uttermoſt of mans perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and conſequently mans ability to preſent to God more perfect and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſervice than he requires) is given through the merits of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. But above all, the <hi>Reall preſence</hi> is the prodigie of opinions in the conceipt of <hi>Protestants;</hi> whoſe playnneſſe in <hi>Scripture</hi> notwithſtanding leaves not where to adde to it with cleerer proofe; as appeares by <hi>Chriſts</hi> words of inſtitution, <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſo often repeated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.19. They fight againſt it therfore with arguments drawn from the power of nature, &amp; think, becauſe it exceeds the power of nature, therfore it cannot be. To whom it may be ſaid, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who thought that mens bodies in heaven were like their bodies here on earth, <hi>ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, Mat.</hi> 22.29. And why then do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe, that God was in the form of a man, a thing as impoſſible in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as for God &amp; man together to be under the form of bread or wine. And becauſe they
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:105178:179"/> would make ſure work if they could, the former objection being in the opinion of many of them inſufficient, they ſay that it doth not only exceed the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of God alſo, in that it implies a contradiction; but this the moſt learned of them have never been able to prove, nor never will, I hope they will all take <hi>Luthers</hi> judgement herein, whom they will not deny to be learned enough to diſcerne a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,<note place="margin">Tom. Wittemb. <hi>1557.</hi> defenſ. verb. Coenae fol. <hi>388</hi>
                  </note> and he ſaith, <hi>what Scripture have they to prove that theſe two Propoſitions be directly contrary? Chriſt ſitteth in heaven, &amp; Chriſt is in the Supper. The contradiction is in their carnall imagination, not in faith, or the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They alſo fright the people from this belief, by preſenting to them the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and inconveniences that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; which objections are but raked out of the aſhes of the old <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> who made the like againſt Gods taking our fleſh upon him, as that it was undecent that God ſhould lie in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans womb nine moneths, that he ſhould be circumciſed, whipt and ſpit upon, and finally ſuffer a moſt ſhamefull and painfull
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:105178:179"/> death. But ſeeing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe believe, that <hi>Christ,</hi> when he was on earth, was ſubject to all humane infirmities except ſin, why ſhould his liableneſſe to ſuch infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties make them forbear to believe that he is in the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> But to acquit them of that trouble, they may take notice, that <hi>Christs</hi> body in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thoſe inconveniences that it was before his death, becauſe it is now a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body, and not ſubject to ſuffer any thing; For as the Sun ſhining on a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill is not defiled therewith, and as the Deity it ſelfe is every where, and yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no infection from the foulneſſe of any place; So the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> being immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and impaſſible, cannot be defiled or hurt with the touch or impreſſion of any unclean or hurtfull thing, more than a man can hurt or defile a Spirit; for of that nature are all glorified bodies, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is ſowen a naturall body; it ſhall riſe a ſpirituall body.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. So that in this reſpect, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have more reaſon to believe the reall preſence of <hi>Chriſts</hi> body in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> than that he once had a reall body converſant here on earth.</p>
               <p>But ſome of them againe do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:105178:180"/> (as they ſay themſelves) the <hi>Reall preſence</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> body in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and therein ſeem to be <hi>Catholiques;</hi> and pleaſe themſelves in ſeeming to be ſo, and think we can deſire no more; but they do but cozen both themſelves and us; for when their <hi>Preſence</hi> is ſifted, we find no reality in it. They ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is really preſent in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but not corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally or bodily: by which <hi>bodily</hi> they mean, either that his body it ſelfe is not there, or that it is not there with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and accidents of a body, as quantity and the like. If they mean the former, to wit, that he is really there, and yet his body is not there, I would faine know how this may be; For a body to be really in any thing, muſt fignifie to be bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or in body there, or nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is really there, who is a body, and yet not there bodily, is the contradiction they ſpeak of, and is in <hi>their</hi> reall preſence, not in the <hi>Catholiques;</hi> For it is as much as if they ſhould ſay, his body is there, and it is not there. If by <hi>not bodily</hi> they mean not with the accidents of his body, as quantity, figure and the like, and that ſo <hi>Christ</hi> is not bodily in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but ſpiritually, that is, after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:105178:180"/> of a Spirit, then they agree with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,</hi> who ſay the ſame, and in this ſenſe he may be, and is both corporally and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually preſent in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Now if by <hi>really</hi> they mean in regard of his Deity, which is every where, this is true, but is not the true meaning of <hi>really;</hi> for he is no more there in this ſenſe, than he is every where elſe, &amp; ſo their confeſſion of a <hi>reall preſence</hi> imports nothing diſtinctly, and is but a deluſion. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> being a man as wel as God, &amp; the body of a man as wel as the Godhead concurring to the making of his perſon, he that is whole <hi>Chriſt</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparated, cannot be ſaid to be any where really, unleſſe he be there alſo bodily; and if his body be there, his body is by us recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that not only ſpiritually, that is, under the conditions of a Spirit, or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by receiving the grace of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into our Spirits, and ſouls; but alſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, in regard of himſelfe, who is a body, and in regard of us, who receive his body into our bodies; and this not by faith, but with faith; that is, not by an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary conceipt that he is there, or that the benefits of his paſſion are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the receiver that thinks ſo, which is the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſaith in this caſe; but
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:105178:181"/> with faith, that is, faith and charity alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in our ſouls, without which though we doe receive him truly &amp; really, yet we do not receive him worthily &amp; profitably.</p>
               <p>But according to the <hi>Protestant</hi> way of receiving, it is impoſſible to receive him unworthily, which is contrary to the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> and the common beliefe of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> for according to them, none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, but they that receive him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, faith being the means with them, which makes them receive him both really and worthily, which who ſo wants, doth not receive at all: ſo that every one that receives him really, receives worthily, and the reſt receive nothing but bread and wine, and ſo do not receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, but only bread and wine at the moſt unworthily; and how this ſhould, make them properly guilty of the body and blood of our Lord, which they do not receive, and liable to damnation thereby, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith it doth, is beyond the reach of my apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Others coming yet nearer, ſay, that they believe the reall and corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but they do not believe <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation;</hi> they believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truly there, but the manner (they ſay) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:105178:181"/> and unexpreſſible. But they ought to know that men ought firmely to believe the manner of a myſtery revealed, when the ſame belongs to the ſubſtance of the myſtery, ſo that rejecting the manner, we reject alſo the ſubſtance of the myſtery. Now the myſtery in ſubſtance is, that the body of <hi>Christ</hi> is preſent in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in ſuch ſort that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> (the Miniſter thereof,) ſhewing what ſeems bread, may truly ſay thereof in the perſon of <hi>Chriſt, this is my body.</hi> This ſuppoſed as the ſubſtance of the myſtery, I infer that two <hi>Catholique doctrines</hi> concerning the manner thereof, belong to the ſubſtance of this myſtery, and cannot be called in queſtion without danger of misbelief. Firſt the reall preſence of the whole body of <hi>Christ</hi> under the forme of bread. Secondly that this is done by <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be done otherwiſe. Even as he that believes the myſtery of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, the ſubſtance whereof is, that in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the nature of God and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man were ſo united, that God is truly man, and man God; he muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily believe that this union is not meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall and in affection only, but true and reall: Secondly that this union is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:105178:182"/> not accidentall; Thirdly that this union of natures is not by making one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of both (as <hi>Eutyches</hi> taught) but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaticall, whereby the nature of God and man is united in one perſon. This my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is high, ſubtile, and incomprehenſible to flagging reaſon, yet muſt be believed ſeeing it belongs to the ſubſtance of the myſtery, which could not be true, if it were not thus: ſo it is in the <hi>reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the novelty of the word, which ſome object, they have little reaſon to do ſo, knowing it is ſome hundreds of years older than the name <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and for the thing, it is as antient as our <hi>Saviours</hi> celebrating his laſt ſupper. And had not the <hi>Catholique</hi> doctrine been oppoſed by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques,</hi> perhaps the word had not yet been in uſe: no more had <hi>conſubstantiall,</hi> uſed in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> had not <hi>Arrius</hi> denyed the Son to be <hi>conſubſtantiall,</hi> or of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father. For the <hi>Church</hi> doth, and may make fit words to explicate the truth of her doctrine, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires; wherein ſhe doth not change the doctrine, but expreſſeth it more plainly or ſignificantly.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Communion in one kind.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. I Will inſtance in two particulars more, becauſe I know that <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> doe mightily check at them; the former is <hi>Communion in one kinde;</hi> the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Prayer in an unknown tongue.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former, <hi>Protestants</hi> are by their <hi>Miniſters</hi> inſtructed to beleeve, that in this matter, <hi>Catholiques</hi> are ſacrilegious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and injurious to men, robbing the <hi>Church</hi> of the precious blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and giving the people a lame and halfe <hi>Sacrament,</hi> inſtead of one whole and entire. But to rectifie their underſtandings, they may be pleas'd to take notice, that the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> doth not count it in it ſelfe unlawfull to receive in both kinds, nor yet doth ſhe hold it neceſſary, but in its owne nature indifferent; and ſo by conſequence determinable to one or both kinds, according to the differences of perſons, times, and places, as ſhe in her wiſedome ſhall think fit. But <hi>Proteſtants</hi> think it abſolutely neceſſary for the Laity to receive in both kinds, firſt becauſe it was ſo inſtituted, ſecondly becauſe it was (as
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:105178:183"/> they think) ſo commanded. Theſe being the two hinges of this their opinion, we muſt here a while arreſt our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; wherein I ſhall ſhew, that there is no precept of receiving under both kinds, and that the inſtitution hath not the force of a precept.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. To begin with the inſtitution, we muſt know, that for a man to be bound to uſe any inſtitution of God, two things are required. Firſt that the end of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be neceſſary, and that it be neceſſary for every particular perſon to endeavour the attaining thereof: whence all men hold, that though the propagation of mankind by marriage, be an inſtitution of God, neceſſary for the continuation of the world; yet while there are enough that comply with that duty, to which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is in generall bound, every particular perſon is not oblig'd to marry. Secondly that if every particular perſon be bound to endeavour to attaine the end of an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that alſo the whole thing inſtituted be neceſſary for the attaining of that end; for if there be variety of meanes ordained, ſufficient for the attaining of that end, a man is not bound to uſe all that which is inſtituted, but it is ſufficient to uſe ſo much
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:105178:183"/> thereof, as will lead a man to that end. Whence all men againe hold, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God created and inſtituted va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of meats and drinks, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of mans corporall life, yet no man is bound to uſe them all, but he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth his duty ſufficiently, if he uſe ſo much of any of them, as will ſuffice to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that end, for which they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, to wit, the maintainanee of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life: ſo that if a man can live of two or three ſorts of meat, he is not bound to uſe ten or twenty; and if he can live of meat without drink, he may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence chooſe whether he will ever drink or no.</p>
               <p>To apply this to our preſent purpoſe, it is apparent enough that by the force of divine inſtitution only, no man is bound to uſe Communion under both kinds. For though the end why <hi>Christ</hi> did inſtitute the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in both kinds be neceſſary, and all muſt endeavour the attaining thereunto, to wit, maintainance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in grace, which is the life of the ſoule; yet there are other meanes of Gods inſtitution alſo, by which we may attaine to this end. Whence it is, that learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines hold, that though the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:105178:184"/> the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> be neceſſary NECES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SETATE PRAECEPTI, <hi>by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of precept,</hi> yet it is not neceſſary, NECESSITATE MEDII, as they ſpeak, that is, the uſe thereof is not ſuch a neceſſary meanes, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſpirituall life, but that a man wanting meanes of ſacred communion, may by other meanes preſerve himſelfe in the ſtate of Grace.</p>
               <p>And though we ſhould ſuppoſe that actuall Communion were a neceſſary meanes to preſerve ſpirituall life, yet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind is abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent thereunto, as I ſhall preſently ſhew; and if ſo, by force of the inſtitution there is no more required. For we muſt know, that there is a great difference between an inſtitution and a precept; the precept of both kinds (if <hi>Christ</hi> gave any) doth bind, whether both kinds be neceſſary for the maintenance of mans ſoule in grace or no; but the inſtitution of both kinds doth not bind to the uſe, further than the thing inſtituted is neceſſary to the maintenance of the ſaid ſpirituall life; to which ſeeing one kind is ſufficient, the inſtitution of both kinds, doth not oblige us to the uſe of both.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:105178:184"/>§. 3. Now that Communion in one kind is ſufficient, (Tranſubſtantiation being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) eaſily appeares; in that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> in the ſole form of bread, (ſeeing it containes the author and fountaine of life, whole and intire, according to body, ſoule, blood, and his infinite perſon,) is abundantly ſufficient for the refection of the ſoule, yea no leſſe than Communion under both kinds. For this one kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it no leſſe than is contained in both, that is, whole <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God and man. His body is there by force of theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and by concomitance there is the blood, the ſoule, the divinity, for there is the perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alive, which implies all theſe particulars, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould be there otherwiſe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt riſing againe from the dead, now dieth no more, death ſhall have no more dominion over him, Rom.</hi> 6.9. And to the receivers of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> by eating only, he promiſeth the end of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which is life; <hi>He that eateth me, he ſhall live by me: John</hi> 6.58.59. and to the ſole recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him under the forme of bread; <hi>He that eateth this bread ſhall live for ever.</hi> And this ſurely he would not have ſaid, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in both kinds had been neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:105178:185"/>§. 4. But becauſe <hi>Protestants</hi> deny <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> I will, without that ſuppoſition, prove, that to <hi>receive in one kind is ſufficient.</hi> Firſt becauſe that in one kind is contained the whole ſubſtance, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and parts of the Sacrament; and ſecondly becauſe it is not againſt any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precept. As for the inſtitution, I have proved already, that it hath not the force of a precept.</p>
               <p>Firſt in one kind alone is contained the whole ſubſtance and eſſence of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> which are theſe fowre; <hi>matter; word, ſignification, cauſality.</hi> Firſt there is the element or <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which is conſecrated bread and manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: ſecondly, there is the <hi>word</hi> or form of ſpeech, ſhewing the divine and ſupernaturall purpoſe, whereto the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is conſecrated, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and theſe two make a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> according to S. <hi>Aug: Accedit verbum ad elementum, &amp; fit Sacramentum.</hi> Thirdly there is a ſigne or <hi>ſignification</hi> therein, and that three-fold: firſt of ſpirituall food, for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoule; ſecondly of union and conjunctions between <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> and between the faithfull one with another, even as in the bread there is
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:105178:185"/> a mixture of flower and water, and in the flower of many graines together. Thirdly the death and paſſion of Chriſt is hereby ſignified; For as by the wine we have a motive to remember his blood, ſhed and ſeparated from his body; ſo by the bread we may conceive his body deprived of blood, by the effuſion thereof upon the croſſe: whereupon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24.25. did after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of each kind, particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the memory of his paſſion; as knowing, thas in each of them alone, was a ſufficient memoriall thereof. Laſtly there is <hi>cauſality,</hi> that is, a working in the ſoule the ſpirituall effects it ſignifies; as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that eateth this bread ſhall live for ever, Joh.</hi> 6.59.</p>
               <p>And if any object, that though there be all the eſſentiall parts of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in one kind, yet there are not all the integrall parts: I anſwer, that bread and wine are not two integrall parts of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> more than the ſeverall particles of the bread and wine are integrall parts; and as the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is ſufficient, whether it be in a greater or leſſe quantity of bread or wine, ſo is it, whether it be in bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or wine only; for our <hi>Saviour</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:105178:186"/> the whole <hi>Sacrament</hi> both in bread, and in wine, as two diſtinct intire matters thereof, not as integrall parts thereof, and gave us leave to uſe or both, or either; as ſhall appeare, in that he hath not obliged us by any precept to the uſe of both. And thus it appeareth, that the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in one kind is full, intire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in ſubſtance, and that by participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, prepared conſciences do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefits of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death, and paſſion.</p>
               <p>Neither doth it hereupon follow, that becauſe the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is eſſentially and intirely contained under either kind, therefore the <hi>Prieſt</hi> receiving underboth, receiveth two <hi>Sacraments,</hi> for being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived both at once, they make but one, as being ordained to one refection, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying one thing, and producing one effect; Even as ſix or ſeven diſhes of meat ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a table do make but one dinner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as part thereof being ſerved one day, and part another, would make two. And the reaſon why <hi>Prieſts</hi> receive under both kinds is, becauſe they offer up a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> repreſenting the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> upon the Croſſe, which were not perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, but by both kinds, wherefore
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:105178:186"/> alſo in this ſort was it prefigured in the Sacrifice of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> offering bread and wine. It being thus proved that whole <hi>Christ,</hi> and the true eſſence and parts of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> are under either kind, it followeth, that in diſtributing it in one kind only, there is no irreverence offered to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> it not being given (as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> thinke) halfe or maimed, but eſſentially and intirely whole: nor is any injury done to the people, by depriving them of any grace meet to ſalvation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very fountaine of grace is no leſſe received under either kind, than under both. Nor is it the opinion of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of <hi>Catholique Divines,</hi> that more grace is obtained by communicating in both kinds, than in one; yet if it were, this advantage might be eaſily ballanced by other meanes; as by the more frequent receiving in one kind, and by our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Church. Now by the premiſſes it is evident, that whether we reſpect the inſtitution of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, no obligation or neceſſity ariſeth of receiving in both kinds. The only queſtion therefore remaining is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be bound thereunto by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Precept of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> or his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:105178:187"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe we are, and for proof thereof alledge theſe places: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe you eat the fleſh of the Son of Man; and drink his blood, you ſhall not have life in you, Joh.</hi> 6.54. And, <hi>taking the Chalice he gave thanks, and gave to them, ſaying, drinke ye all of this, Mat.</hi> 26.27. Alſo, <hi>In like manner the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice after he had ſupped, ſaying, this Chalice is the New Teſtament in my blood, this do ye, as often as yee ſhall drinke, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. But none of theſe places rightly underſtood, nor any other, do prove, what the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. Particularly to the firſt of theſe places I anſwer, that ſeeing the Proteſtants do generally interpret this Chapter of S. <hi>John,</hi> not of receiving the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but onely of believing in Chriſt, it is no objection for them; but becauſe moſt <hi>Catholique Divines</hi> do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> it is an objection againſt us; to which therefore I further anſwer: Firſt, that all words of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that in their forme ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Precept, do not ſo indeed; as where our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that they ought to waſh one anothers feet, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.14. yet no man ever held it for a matter of neceſſity. But ſuppoſing for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:105178:187"/> that it include a Precept, I further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that as we diſtinguiſh in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the ſubſtance and the manner, the ſubſtance being to receive <hi>Christ,</hi> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to receive him in both kinds, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall eating and drinking; So the ſame diſtinction is to be made in our <hi>Saviours</hi> Precept about this <hi>Sacrament.</hi> For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his words may ſound of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of receiving in both kinds, yet his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is to command no more than the ſubſtance, to wit, that we really receive his body and blood, which may be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind.</p>
               <p>The truth whereof will appeare if we conſider, firſt the occaſion of the words objected, which was the incredulity of the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> whoſe doubt was not whether the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was to be given in one or both kinds, but (as <hi>Protestants</hi> ſtill doubt) whether he could give us his fleſh to eat. Secondly the manner of his ſpeech, which was not by making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any kind at all in the ſaid words, but only of the things themſelves; for he doth not ſay, unleſſe you eat the bread and drink the wine, you have no life, but, <hi>unleſſe you eat the fleſh and drink the blood;</hi> both which are equally contained under
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:105178:188"/> either bread or wine; So that if a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the forme of bread only, or of wine only, he doth therein both eat and drinke the fleſh and blood of <hi>Christ.</hi> And in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of this Chapter, where he makes mention of one kind, it is of bread only, and not at all of wine: ſo that this place is of no force, for the forme of wine, unleſſe the body and blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſeparated, and that receiving the form of bread, we receive the body onely, and of wine the blood only, which muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtill dead, which is moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. And if any think, that becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>unleſſe you drinke,</hi> therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be received under a forme that may be drunke as well as eaten, or elſe it is not drinking his blood, but eating his blood, as well as his body; I anſwer, it is called eating and drinking, not ſo much in regard of the action, as the ſubject; ſo that fleſh being the uſuall ſubject of eating, when the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is called fleſh, the action is called eating; and blood being the uſuall ſubject of drinking, when there is mention of receiving the blood, the action is called drinking; and we are not bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in a drinkable forme, becauſe we
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:105178:188"/> are bid, to drink his blood, but we may be ſaid to drink, becauſe we receive that which is in its nature drinkable, to wit, blood, which we doe, when we receive the body. And if this will not ſerve the turn, they may further argue againſt us, that if we ſwallow the Hoſt whole, we do not eat it, eating implying, chewing, more or leſſe, and ſo do not fulfill the precept of eating the fleſh. And we may argue in like manner againſt them, that if they do not take wine enough to make a draught, they do not drinke, but onely taſt or ſip thereof, and therein alſo do not fulfill that which they think they are here comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But as a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (I ſuppoſe if the bread and wine ſhould be ſo mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a cup, that both might be drunk together, or elſe eaten with a ſpoon, or in the manner of a moiſt piece of paſt, or ſwallowed like a pill,) will believe that he receives in both kinds, and fulfills this (in his opinion) Precept of drinking the blood; So the body and blood being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together in either kind, to us that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> we receive both, when we receive either kind, which act of receiving with relation to the fleſh may be called eating, to the blood, drinking,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:105178:189"/> yea though it ſhould be taken in ſuch a manner, as ſtrictly ſpeaking, ſhould bee neither eating nor drinking.</p>
               <p>I adde moreover, (with relation to them that do not believe <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>) that the conjunctive particle <hi>[And]</hi> doth frequently ſignifie disjunctively, that is, <hi>[Or:]</hi> For example, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Acts</hi> 3.6.) <hi>Silver and gold have I none,</hi> where it is manifeſt that the ſenſe is, ſilver <hi>or</hi> gold I have none; for if he had had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had had no excuſe of want, for his not giving of almes. So alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of this very <hi>Sacrament,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. 27. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himſelfe;</hi> which he interpreteth in the ſame Chapter, ſaying, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, or drink the cup of our Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.</hi> In like manner thoſe words, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eat the fleſh, and drink the blood,</hi> if they be taken for eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeverall formes of bread and wine, are to be underſtood disjunctively, thus, <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh, or drink the blood of the ſonne of man, you ſhall not have life in you.</hi> Which disjunctive ſenſe is proved to be the ſenſe intended in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe elſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:105178:189"/> for he promiſeth in this ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life eternall to eating only, <hi>He that eateth me, the ſame ſhall live by me,</hi> and, <hi>he that eateth this bread ſhall live for ever;</hi> now if he require unto life eternall, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking both, under diſtinct forms and kinds, it is manifeſt he ſhould contradict himſelfe: and becauſe this is impoſſible, we muſt neceſſarily interpret this place, with relation to the ſeverall formes of bread and wine, disjunctively, thus, <hi>unleſſe you eat or drink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond text urged for Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both kinds, is, <hi>Drinks ye all of this, Mat.</hi> 26.27. which being rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, will appeare to be ſpoken, neither to all mankind, as to <hi>Jewes, Turks, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells;</hi> as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alſo acknowledge, nor yet to all the faithfull, but to all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and to them all only: Which is manifeſt out of the Text it ſelf; for what one <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſaith was commanded to all, another relates to have been anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably performed by all, <hi>They drank all thereof, Mark</hi> 14.23. But the ſecond <hi>All</hi> is reſtrained to all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then is there to extend the former words further then to all the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> And the reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>drink
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:105178:190"/> yee all of this,</hi> and did not ſay, eat ye all of this, was not, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> fore-ſaw that ſome would deny the uſe of the Chalice to the Communicants, but that the firſt to whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave the cup, and ſo the reſt untill the laſt, were to know, that they were not to drink all, but were to leave ſo much, as might ſuffice for them or him that was to drink after, without new filling and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. Which forme of words, he uſed moſt plainely a little before the ſupper of the <hi>Paſche:</hi> for as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.17. <hi>Taking the chalice he gave thanks, and ſaid, take it, and divide it amongſt you;</hi> whereas breaking the bread himſelfe, and giving to every one his part, and not the whole to be divided amongſt them, there was no ſuch neceſſity of the ſaid words.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. As for the words of our <hi>Saviour, doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> they doe no waies infer a precept of receiving in both kinds. Firſt becauſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid theſe words abſolutely only of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the forme of bread, but in the forme of wine only conditionally, <hi>doe this, as oft as ye ſhall drink, in remembrance of me;</hi> not commanding them to drink, but in caſe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:105178:190"/> they did drink, (which was lawfull and uſuall in thoſe times, but not ſo now, as I ſhall ſhew by and by,) that then they ſhould doe it in memory of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that this precept, <hi>do this,</hi> being the only precept given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his <hi>Church</hi> concerning this matter, and given abſolutely of the forme of bread, conditionally of the form of wine, there is no colour to accuſe the Church of doing againſt <hi>Chriſts</hi> precept, by communion under one kind only. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith (<hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1 18.) that, <hi>Our Lord did not appoint in what order the Sacrament of the Eucharist was to be taken afterward, but left authority unto the Apoſtles to make ſuch appointments, by whom he was to diſpoſe and order his Churches.</hi> But ſuppoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſpoken theſe imperative words, <hi>doe this,</hi> after the giving of the cup, yet are they to be underſtood with reſtriction to thoſe things that belong to the eſſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this action; for if we extend it further, to the accidentary circumſtances thereof, in which <hi>Christ</hi> did then inſtitute and give the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> many abſurdities will follow. For by this rule we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies celebrate the <hi>Eucharist</hi> after ſupper, and in unleavened bread, the receivers muſt take it into their hands, and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> muſt
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:105178:191"/> waſh the feet of thoſe to whom he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters it, with the like. Now ſeeing to bind men to theſe circumſtances of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> action, is (in all mens judgements) very abſurd, we muſt not extend the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>doe this,</hi> to the ſaid, or the like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, but acknowledge that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept includes only the doing of that which pertaines to the ſubſtance of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of which kind, communion in both kinds cannot be, it being alſo a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſubſtance thereof being intire in one only kind, as hath been proved. So that the <hi>Protestants</hi> wrangling thus for the cup, doe but fulfill in themſelves (though in a different ſenſe) the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ERIT CLAMOR IN PLATEIS SUPER VINO; <hi>there ſhall be crying for wine in the ſtreets, Iſay</hi> 24.11.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeares, that Communion in both kinds is not of the eſſence or integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> nor neceſſary by any divine precept; from whence it followes, that as a thing indifferent, it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or reſtrained, according as the wiſedome of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhall think fit. For the precinct of humane power ſtreacheth to things indifferent, and only to them. Things abſolutely commanded, man cannot
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:105178:191"/> forbid; things abſolutely forbidden, man cannot command; and therefore the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of humane legiſlative power, muſt be in things indifferent, or elſe there is none at all; which is againſt Scripture, reaſon, and the moſt generall beleef and practiſe of mankind. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this power upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon them a new law of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for a time, <hi>from things offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls, and blood, and that which is ſtrangled; Acts</hi> 15.29. which yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impoſed, but left it indifferent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as after the Apoſtles decree, it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; wherefore it is ſaid, that S. <hi>Paul walked through Syria and Cilicia confirming the Churches, commanding them to keep the precepts of the Apoſtles and Elders, Acts</hi> 15.41.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Now the reaſons moving the <hi>Church</hi> to reſtrain communion to one kind, were many and weighty. Firſt to prevent thereby the occaſion of error; for whereas in the primitive <hi>Church,</hi> the uſe of one or both kinds was indifferently practiſed, as is apparent by teſtimonies of antiquity, yea by the example of the <hi>Apoſtles, Acts</hi> 2.42. and our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelfe <hi>Luke</hi> 26.30. yet. when as the <hi>Manichean heretiques</hi>

So in more antient times when the <hi>Ebionites</hi> taught unleavened bread to bee neceſſary in conſecration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> commanded the conſecration thereof to be made in leavened bread; And when the heretique <hi>Nestorius</hi> denyed our <hi>Bleſſed Lady</hi> to be the mother of God, and only to be called the mother of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and commanded that ſhe ſhould be called Mother of God. And the <hi>Church</hi> hath ever found this the moſt effectuall
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:105178:192"/> means, for the confutation and extirpation of hereſie, namely, by contrary decrees and practiſe to declare and publiſh the truth.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon moving the <hi>Church</hi> to forbid the uſe of the cup, was the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved reverence due to this higheſt <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> in conſideration whereof, the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers</hi> did appoint moſt diligent care to be uſed, leſt any little particle of the Hoſt, or drop of the Chalice ſhould fall to the ground.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Liturgie and private prayers for the ignorant in an unknowne tongue.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>PRayer in an unknowne tongue</hi> hath two branches, one concerning publique prayer in a tongue, which the people that are preſent doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:105178:193"/> the other private prayer, in a tongue, which the party praying doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; both which <hi>Protestants</hi> think ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in reaſon, and contrary to Scripture; but <hi>Catholiques</hi> beleeve truly that they are neither. For maintenance whereof, let us conſider the meaning of S. <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor. ch.</hi> 14.) the place by them violently, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently objected againſt us.</p>
               <p>We muſt then know, that as the gift of tongues was given to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> when he in the ſhape of tongues deſended upon them; ſo the ſame gift, with divers others, was continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Chriſtians for ſome time after. This gift, amongſt the other, they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in their publique Church-meetings, where they aſſembled for the benefit &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the hearers, ſpeaking ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary prayer, or other holy diſcourſe, both for matter and language, as the Spirit gave them utterance, with great affection &amp; elevation of the mind towards God. Yea the language many times was ſuch, as no man preſent underſtood, as is intimated verſe 2. <hi>for he that ſpeaketh in an unknowne tongue, &amp;c. no man underſtands him;</hi> no nor many times did the ſpeaker underſtand himſelfe; for the gift of tongues, and the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105178:193"/> gift of interpretation of tongues were two diſtinct gifts, as we ſee in the 12. ch. and did not alwaies meet together, as we may gather from the 13. verſe of this <hi>chapter,</hi> where the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorteth him that ſpeaketh in an unknowne tongue, to <hi>pray that he may interpret,</hi> which was a ſigne that ordinarily they could not; &amp; by verſe 14. where he ſaith, <hi>If I pray in a tongue, my ſpirit prayeth, but my understanding is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull;</hi> now this muſt be meant of a tongue, which he himſelf did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, otherwiſe his own underſtanding could not be unfruitful. And thus alſo doth S. <hi>Auguſtine (de Geneſ. ad lit. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.9.) and other Fathers interpret S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this it is manifeſt that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not here reprove the practiſe of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> in her Latine <hi>Liturgie</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, ſeeing this here reproved, and that are extreamly different. Therefore ours can be only ſo far reprovable, as it agrees with the other in the reaſons for which it was reproved, which are want of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; therby want of edification to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, &amp; of ſufficient warrant to the unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, through want of underſtanding of what was ſaid, to ſay thereto <hi>Amen.</hi> Now ſeeing ours doth not agree with that, in any
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:105178:194"/> of theſe, it is therefore irreproveable. Yet if it ſhould agree with that in any of theſe, it ſhould not notwithſtanding be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; becauſe they differ in the maine and principall part, the end; for theſe Church-meetings were intended for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; edification of the auditors, therefore it was fit the exerciſes thereof ſhould be in a tongue which they that were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, underſtood, but the publike <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> was inſtituted for the ſervice &amp; praiſe of God, &amp; therfore may be, without unlawfulneſſe, in any tongue that he underſtands, to whom it is dedicated.</p>
               <p>The truth of all this will appear, if we conſider the differences between that caſe and ours. The languages then ſpoken were utterly unknowne many times to any man there preſent, even to the ſpeaker himſelf, but the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or languages known to very many, as the <hi>Latin</hi> in the <hi>Latin Church</hi> to all Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to moſt Gentlemen, &amp; youths bred in Grammer Schools, &amp; in ſome countries to moſt Mechanicks; it cannot therfore abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely be ſaid to be an unknown tongue. And though it cannot be proved unlawful to have the <hi>Liturgie</hi> in a tongue abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknowne, yet where the Latin tongue
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105178:194"/> hath been unknowne to all or moſt of the better ſort, the <hi>Church</hi> hath diſpenſed with the uſe thereof; as appears by the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pope Paul</hi> 5. to turn the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> into the vulgar language of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> &amp; to uſe the ſame until the Latin tongue grew more known &amp; familiar in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Moreover the prayers &amp; other ſpiritual excerciſes which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks againſt, were extemporall, made in publike meetings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſent inſpired devotion of the ſpeaker; So that the unlearned hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or he that ſupplied his place, the Clark, except he underſtood the language, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the matter, could not prudently ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it, ſeeing he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing that was ſpoken, were good and lawfull or no. But the <hi>Liturgie</hi> &amp; Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church hath ſet offices for every day, approved by the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; therefore from hence a man may be confidently aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it is good &amp; lawfull, and therefore he may boldly ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> Beſides there are means applied to the ignorant multitude, by which they are, or may be (if they uſe diligence therein) made to underſtand the publike Prayers of the <hi>Church;</hi> namely <hi>Sermons, Exhortations, Catechiſmes, private inſtructions, Manualls</hi> &amp; <hi>Primers</hi> in vulgar
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:105178:195"/> languages, where the Prayers uſed in the <hi>Church</hi> are found: So that the ordinary &amp; common paſſages of the publike Service may be, and are eaſily underſtood even by women &amp; children, &amp; they may underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> Therefore as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did allow of an unknowne tongue in the exerciſes of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> provided there were ſome to interpret it; ſo the Service in Latin is very allowable even under this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while there are the aforeſaid meanes uſed for the interpretation thereof.</p>
               <p>And the Congregation is edified, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> appoints it ſhould be, by the things that are done &amp; ſaid in the <hi>Church,</hi> while the people have but a generall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the ſeverall paſſages thereof. And if they were in a vulgar language, the difference for matter of underſtanding would be but in a little more or leſſe; for that every woman, boy, &amp; girl in a <hi>Church,</hi> ſhould be able to underſtand word by word the <hi>Liturgie</hi> therof, be it in what language it will, is morally impoſſible; ſeeing there are great ſtore of words in every tongue in common uſe amongſt the better ſort, which common people do not underſtand. And ſuppoſe this might be avoided in thoſe parts of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which are compoſed
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105178:195"/> by the <hi>Church,</hi> by making choice of the moſt vulgar words that might be found, yet it is impoſſible to be ſo in that which makes the greateſt part of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> to wit, the Scripture. And if yet all the words of the Scripture could be bowed to their underſtanding, for the Grammatical ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereof, yet without all paradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſenſe, (which is the chiefe thing to be underſtood, and for which only the language doth ſerve, by reaſon of the innumerable figurative ſpeeches therein) is altogether impoſſible. For example let any unlearned <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſay, whether theſe following places in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for ſo much as concernes the full ſenſe thereof, be not all one to him, as if they were in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> I will ſet them downe according to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Proteſtant</hi> tranſlation, and their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Pſalmes. <hi>Moab is my waſhpot, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Edom will I caſt out my ſhoe, Pſal.</hi> 60.8. Alſo this, <hi>Though ye have lien among the pots, yet ſhall ye be as the wings of a dove co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſilver, and her feathers with yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low gold, Pſal.</hi> 68. <hi>v.</hi> 13. And this in the ſame Pſalme, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>Rebuke the company of ſpearemen;</hi> or as it is in the margent, <hi>the beaſts of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the people &amp;c.</hi> Alſo this as
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:105178:196"/> it is in the <hi>Service book; Or ever your pots be made hot with thornes, ſo let indignation vex him even as a thing that is raw, Pſal.</hi> 58.8. Therefore when <hi>Protestants</hi> read theſe and the like unintelligible places of Scripture to the unlearned people, without interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, their end in reading being only the inſtruction of the people, they truly fal into that error, of which they untruely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us, of ſpeaking in the <hi>Church</hi> without the edification of the people. So have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them alone in their Sermons alſo, ſpeaking Latin, or ſome other more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, without interpreting it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the end of the Church meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings here ſpoken of by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> was to inſtruct the ignorant, and convert the infidels, as may be gathered out of the 23. and 24. verſes. But the drift of the <hi>Church</hi> in appointing <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and ſet formes of publique prayer, and readings in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> was not for the peoples inſtruction, though that as I have ſhewed be not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but for other reaſons: as firſt, that by this publique ſervice, a continuall dayly tribute or homage of prayer and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving might be publiquely offered and payed unto God by his <hi>Prieſts:</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by their perſonall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:105178:196"/> at this publike Service, might profeſſe &amp; exerciſe exterior acts of religion common with the whole <hi>Church,</hi> repreſented by the <hi>Synaxis</hi> or eccleſiaſticall meeting of every Chriſtian Pariſh. Finally, that every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> by his preſence yeelding conſent unto the publike prayers, praiſes &amp; thanksgiving of the <hi>Church,</hi> might participate of the graces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, &amp; fruits, which the <hi>Church</hi> doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily obtaine by her <hi>Liturgies</hi> &amp; publike ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Now for theſe ends there is no need that every one ſhould underſtand word by word the prayers that are ſaid in the publike Liturgie, but it ſufficeth that the <hi>Church</hi> in generall, and in particular, Paſtors &amp; Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical perſons dedicated to the Miniſteries of the <hi>Church,</hi> have particular notice of all the prayers that are ſaid, and that all may be taught, and inſtructed in particular, if they deſire it, and will be diligent therein.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Protestants</hi> are more eaſily lead into this error, of beleeving, that the <hi>Church</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice muſt be ſaid in the vulgar tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conceive the principall intent thereof with us, is, as it is with them, for the inſtruction of the people. For with them they doe not uſually read the <hi>Church Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> unleſſe there be company to heare, not is there any receiving of their Communion,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:105178:197"/> unleſſe there be a number of the people to communicate; But in the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> it is not ſo; for with us the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is ſaid, though there ſhould be no people preſent, for it is the <hi>Prieſts</hi> Office, &amp; not the peoples; and the daily <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is offered, though there be no people preſent; theſe are done to the ſervice &amp; honour of God, and for the benefit of the people too, (though not for their inſtruction,) and they are bound to be preſent at <hi>Maſſe</hi> only upon <hi>Sundaies</hi> &amp; other <hi>Holydaies,</hi> yet may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at any other time, and are preſent more frequently &amp; numerouſly than the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are at their Service or Sermons: and for the ſubſtance of things done or ſaid, underſtand much more. And all women &amp; children in their anſwers to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> are as ready, (if not more) than ever they were in the uſe of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And while they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the generall purport of that which is ſaid, though they cannot apply every Latin word to its proper ſignification in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, yet I ſuppoſe their underſtandings are more edified, then theirs that know the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of moſt of the words, but not a jot of the inward ſenſe &amp; meaning thereof, as happens to the unlearned <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> while they hear moſt parts of the Scripture read in the vulgar tongue.</p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:105178:197"/>
               <p>Moreover moſt certain it is, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent cuſtome of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> to have their <hi>Liturgie</hi> in a tongue not vulgar, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the cuſtome of the <hi>Church</hi> in all ages, and alſo of all <hi>Churches</hi> now in the world, bearing the name of Chriſtian, (though oppoſite to the <hi>Roman</hi>) only thoſe of the pretended Reformation excepted: which conſtant concurrence is a great ſigne that the ſame is very conform unto reaſon, &amp; not any where forbidden in the Word of God. The Scripture was not read in any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage but Greek over al the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> as S. <hi>Jerom (praefat. in Paralip.)</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth.

Chriſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 123. <hi>&amp; in Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. Ep. ad Rom. &amp; Ep.</hi> 173.) Yet was not the Latin the vulgar language of all the nations of the Weſt, but every one had his owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, as now they have, &amp; particularly in <hi>England</hi> the Britiſh language was then in uſe. Nor yet was the Latin language vulgarly known in all theſe nations, though under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the beteer ſort, as it is at this day; &amp; in all likelihood more generally known now, than then, in as much as the ſtudy of Arts &amp; Sciences, &amp; communion in Religion, are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes to ſpread a language, than the ſword of a Conqueror. So that it is manifeſt that the <hi>Christian Church</hi> did never judge it requiſite, that the publike <hi>Liturgie</hi> ſhould be turned into the mother tongue of every nation, nor neceſſary that it ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently underſtood word by word by every one of the vulgar aſſiſtants; neither doth the end of the publike Service require it: As for thoſe Sects that uſe no Liturgie at all, but in
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:105178:198"/> their Church-meetings do only make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporall prayer before &amp; after Sermon, (as the cuſtome is now for the moſt part in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) that the people may pray with them, they do as they ought in uſing the vulgar tongue; &amp; <hi>Catholiques</hi> (if they uſed ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe) no doubt would do it in like manner.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. As for the comfort &amp; more plentifull edification of the underſtanding which ſome few want, in that they do not ſo perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all the particulars of divine Service, it may by other means abundantly be ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without turning the publike <hi>Liturgie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to innumerable vulgar languages, which would bring great confuſion into the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.</hi> For firſt the <hi>Church</hi> could not be able to judge of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of every country, when differences aroſe about the tranſlation thereof; and ſo divers errors &amp; hereſies might creep into particular coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and the whole <hi>Church</hi> never able to take notice thereof. Secondly, particular countries could not be certain that they had the parts of the Scripture uſed in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie truly tranſlated; for they can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſured proof thereof, than the Churches approbation; nor can ſhe approve what ſhe her ſelf doth not underſtand. Thirdly, if there were as many tranſlations of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> as
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:105178:199"/> there be ſeverall languages in the world, it could not be avoided, but that ſome would in many places be ridiculous, incongruous, and full of miſtaking, to the great prejudice of ſouls, eſpecially in languages that have no great extent, nor many learned men that naturally ſpeak them. Fourthly, the <hi>Liturgie</hi> muſt of neceſſity be often changed, together with the language, which doth much alter in every age, as is very well knowne. Fifthly, in the ſame country, by reaſon of different dialects, ſome provinces underſtand not one another; and in the Iſland of <hi>Japonia</hi> (as ſome write) there is one language for men, another for women; one language for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, another for ruſticks: into what lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage then ſhould the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of <hi>Japonia</hi> be tranſlated? So that it is cleer, that the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of divine Service tranſlated in all vulgar languages are inſuperable, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is but to the moſt ignorant part, and that but in part, and to be recompenced by other means, and is ſo, by prayer books, and other inſtructions in abundance in the vulgar tongue; In ſo much that I dare boldly ſay, (for I have been an eye-witneſſe) that in the cities of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> there is five times as much preaching, and ten times as much catechiſing of youth and ignorant people, as
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:105178:199"/> is in <hi>London;</hi> ſo that blindneſſe &amp; ignorance to <hi>Catholiques,</hi> is ignorantly &amp; blindly obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Laſtly we cannot imagine that if S. <hi>Paul</hi> had intended, that which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to enforce out of the above-named <hi>chapter</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that both he and his fellow <hi>Apoſtles</hi> would have practiſed the contrary at the writing thereof, and all their lives after; for we doe not find that they or any after them did uſe any <hi>Liturgie,</hi> but in one of the learned languages, which though they were vulgar to ſome people in thoſe times, yet but to a ſmall part, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of all the nations of the world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they celebrated <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. As for private prayer, the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church</hi> permits all men, whether out of the Churches, or in them, to pray in what language they pleaſe; yea the <hi>Pater,</hi> the <hi>Ave,</hi> and the <hi>Creed,</hi> are commanded by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Councells</hi> to be learned in the vulgar tongue; and divers bookes of prayers in the vulgar tongue are publiſhed and uſed in all <hi>Catholique Countries.</hi> Yet thoſe <hi>Catholiques</hi> that do pray or ſing <hi>Pſalmes</hi> in Latin, which they doe not underſtand, either by choice or obligation, are not to be condemned. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they underſtand the prayer in the whole maſſe thereof, as the PATER NOSTER, for
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:105178:200"/> example, though they know not perhaps whether PATER ſignifie <hi>our,</hi> and NOSTER, <hi>father,</hi> or the contrary, yet ſaying this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with due devotion, and knowing that it is our Lords prayer, which they can very well repeat in their mother tongue, no man I ſuppoſe can be ſo abſurd to think this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not acceptable to God, though the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts be not meaſured geometrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the words. Or elſe they underſtand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more generally, that ſuch or ſuch a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Pſalme, for example, MISERERE, is a Pſalme full of penitent affections, and this they ſay with much inward ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition for their ſinnes; and who can deny that this pious affection is pleaſing to God, though the thoughts and words doe not mathematically correſpond the one to the other, I am ſure the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> approved the like, ſaying in the 17. verſe of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned chapter, <hi>Thou verily givest thanks well;</hi> And to conclude, he doth abſolutely allow it, in the 28. verſe ſaying, <hi>But if there be no interpreter let him keepe ſilence in the Church, and let him ſpeak to God and himſelfe.</hi> And in this matter, as well as the reſt, the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> alſo may keep ſilence, unleſſe they could ſpeak more to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Theſe points &amp; all other I examined
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:105178:200"/> with diligence, and found that <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> ordinarily did not truly apprehend many of the <hi>Catholique doctrines,</hi> nor juſtly oppoſe any of them. But I have only touched theſe few particulars, to let the unlearned <hi>Protestant Reader</hi> ſee, that the <hi>Catholique doctrines</hi> are not ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous things, as they ordinarily conceive them, but rather that it is monſtrous in them not to believe them. And to awaken the further diligence of all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to ſearch into the truth of all points, ſo far as they are able either by themſelves or others, (if they will not at the firſt caſt themſelves upon the infallibility of the Church, which I conceive I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved in the former part of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and is the ſhorteſt and ſureſt way) and to read the Bookes of <hi>Catholiques</hi> ſet forth to this purpoſe; &amp; not to exerciſe an implicite faith to the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and even againſt the rule of it, to their hurt, ſeeing they will not yet do it to the <hi>Catholique Religion,</hi> to their advantage: In which <hi>Catholique books</hi> they ſhall find all the Pleas for <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> all their objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt <hi>Catholique doctrine</hi> anſwered, with that learning and ſolidity, with that cleerneſſe and fullneſſe, that were not
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:105178:201"/> faith alſo required (which is the gift of God only) to the apprehenſion of thoſe things, which the Church teaches, it were impoſſible (in my judgement) impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (I ſay) that any reaſonable man ſhould continue (in his judgement) a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet many there are I fear, who though they be in belief and judgement <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi> yet in outward profeſſion are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> Who like the inferiour ſpheares, which are moved one way by the PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MUM MOBILE, and a contrary way by their owne peculiar motion; So they are moved to believe the <hi>Catholique verities</hi> by the influence of God upon their ſoules, but to remain in the <hi>Proteſtant Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> by the private inſtigations of fleſh and blood; Who wanting the ſeaſoning of Charity, doe warp and ſhrink from that, to which their judgement hath joyned them; Whoſe faith like bullion though it be good metall in it ſelfe, yet wanting the ſtamp of of <hi>Catholique Communion</hi> and obedience, is not currant in the Kingdome of heaven, nor will ſerve in their journey to defray them thither. But they (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the condition of all weak minds) accounting the Preſent evill (as loſſe of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:105178:201"/> goods, friends, and the like) the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, deſire to avoid that, and put to adventure the enſuing: And ſo while they <hi>ſaile</hi> through the troubleſome <hi>Sea</hi> of this life, unskilfull of <hi>ſteerage</hi> in a ſtorme, do ſtrike and <hi>ſplit</hi> their ſoules upon the <hi>flats</hi> of fear, and <hi>rocks</hi> of preſumption: forgetfull of that dreadfull threatning of our Saviour, <hi>He that ſhall deny mee before men, ſhall be denyed before the Angells of God,</hi> Luc. 12.9.</p>
               <p>Now to the diligence of examination before mentioned, for thoſe that are not yet convinced in their judgements, a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> is bound by <hi>Chillingworths</hi> owne rule; who (though he ſay that for as much as there is no infallible guide, and that therefore a man muſt follow the choice of his own reaſon in what he doth believe, and that God will be contented with that, be it more or leſſe, true or falſe, being as much as he can attain to, yet) addes withall, that a man muſt imploy his uttermoſt endeavours to the finding out of the truth. And who is it amongſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that hath done that? Who hath ſpent all his ſpare time, much leſſe, who hath ſpared all the time he could to this enquiry? I think no <hi>Proteſtants</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:105178:202"/> can acquit him in this caſe; and if not, he muſt not think to quiet himſelfe by ſaying, that to the beſt of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> ſeemes true, if he have not imployed all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to find whether it be ſo or no; which cannot be, unleſſe (with King <hi>Philip of Macedon</hi> he keep one ear for the party accuſed) hee equally heare both ſides.</p>
               <p>Wherefore deveſting themſelves of all prejudice and prepoſſeſſed opinions, like white paper, wherein there is nothing written, let them addreſſe themſelves with all their ſpare time, yea they ought to make ſpare time, rather than to want it, to a ſad and ſerious conſideration of the great buſineſſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of who ſo gaines, though with the loſſe of all temporall felicity, doth highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his eſtate; conſidering that, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>what will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and to loſe his owne ſoule? Math.</hi> 16.16. And let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this moſt important affaire, and put it off to the later end of his life, (which how ſoon it will happen, the youngeſt know not;) as if the Kingdome of heaven were like a market, cheapeſt at the later end of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:105178:202"/> the day; or that becauſe nature hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſeat of his memory in the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of his head, therefore he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the remembrance of God, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him by the path of true <hi>Religion,</hi> to the hindermoſt part of his life. But as God himſelfe ſaith, <hi>while it is called to day, harden not your hearts, Pſal.</hi> 94.8. leſt his delay pull upon himſelfe the forſaking of God, and ſteel his forehead to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall refuſall of his mercifull invitation; and ſo he (and eſpecially the Citty of <hi>London,</hi> which hath been purpled with the blood of ſo many martyrs) hear the complaint and curſe of our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his eare, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, which killest the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent to thee; how often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thy children as the hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and you would not behold your habitation ſhall be left unto you deſolate, Math.</hi> 23.37.</p>

                  <p>Of the fooliſh, deceitfull and abſurd procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and behaviour of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in matter of Religion; And of the vanity and injuſtice of their pretext of conſcience for their ſeparation from the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. HE that will apply himſelf to this inqueſt as I have done, ſhall find, that the objections of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Catholique Doctrines</hi> are very weak and ſleight, they are but paper-pellets, and make more noiſe than hurt; the workes alſo that they raiſe for their owne defence are as weak, and eaſily diſmantled. I found that their objections were anſwered again and again, which a later writer would take no notice of, but retrive the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and urge them as freſh, as if they had never been urged before, or at leaſt had never been anſwered; forgetting to make reply to the <hi>Catholique Anſwers,</hi> which was indeed becauſe they could not do it. And in their writings I found much abuſe of all Authors, even from the <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf to the Authors of lateſt times, either miſalledging the words, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or miſconſtruing
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:105178:203"/> the meaning, or urging that for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which was indeed to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Particularly for their miſtranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Scripture,</hi> (wherein they grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſe one another, as I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) I will alledge two or three places (of a great many) for a taſt, wherein their unfaithfulneſſe is apparent; as firſt that notable depravation of their <hi>Maſter Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which I have mentioned before, in adding the word <hi>[only]</hi> where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that <hi>a man is juſtified by faith without the works of the Law, Rom.</hi> 3.28. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>give diligence by good works to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. the Engliſh <hi>Bibles</hi> leave out theſe words, <hi>by good works,</hi> and yet <hi>Beza</hi> in his notes upon the place, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges theſe words to be in almoſt all the antient Greek Copies. Alſo in the ſame Chapter &amp; fifteenth <hi>Verſe,</hi> theſe words are read according to the originall, <hi>I will do my diligence alſo, you to have often after my deceaſe, that you may have a remembrance of theſe things:</hi> ſhewing thereby that he would pray for them after he was dead; as S. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> expounds it, ſaying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce ever (you bleſſed Apoſtles) in our Lord, without intermiſſion pray for us, fulfill your
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:105178:204"/> promiſes; for ô Bleſſed Peter thou cryest out ſpeaking thus, I will do my diligence after my coming to make mention of you,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. Now the Engliſh Bibles read this place thus, <hi>Moreover I will indeavour, that you may be able after my deceaſe, to have theſe things alwaies in remembrance,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the ſenſe, and making it ſignifie only that he would indeavour that they ſhould remember thoſe things, when he was dead; whereas he ſaith, that he would indeavour after he was dead, that they ſhould remember thoſe things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it proves that he prayed for them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be was dead; a Doctrine which many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not allow. Alſo in the firſt <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Chap.</hi> 11. v. 27. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily ſhall be guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord,</hi> the Engliſh tranſlates it thus, <hi>whoſoever ſhall eat this bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>and</hi> for <hi>or,</hi> thereby making the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſpeak of the receiving of the bread and wine unworthily in an united ſenſe, whereas he ſpeakes of them in a divided ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Thus in very many places do they deal
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:105178:204"/> with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> like the <hi>Elephant</hi> when he goes to drink, who troubles the cleer water with his feet, becauſe he will not ſee the deformity of his face; So they trouble and defile the ſenſe of <hi>Scripture</hi> either in words or expoſition, becauſe they would not ſee the deformity of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Many falſifications alſo and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Catholique Authors,</hi> by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant writers,</hi> I have met with; as where they ſpeaking ſomething by way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, they alledge them as if they ſpeak it poſitively and abſolutely; where they bring the objections of <hi>Heretiques,</hi> they alledge them as ſpeaking the words in their owne names; where they relate with reprehenſion the ſayings of wicked men, they alledge them as ſaying thoſe words themſelves; which is, as if they ſhould charge S. <hi>Mathew</hi> himſelfe with the words of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> againſt our Saviour, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a glutton and a drinker of wine. Math.</hi> 11.19. But I will not be particular in this matter, becauſe many that have been guilty in this caſe, have been called to a ſtrict account by their <hi>Catholique anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when they are preſſed by <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> with plaine and direct proofes, O
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:105178:205"/> what ſerpentine wriglings and windings, to eſcape the aſſaulters, doe they make! O what perverſe, ridiculous, &amp; contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwers and evaſions do ſome of them make! in which they doe at once ſhew both much wit, and much folly; for fooles could not ſpeak as they doe, and wiſe men would not. In ſo much that<note n="a" place="margin">Anſwer to a Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites challenge, chapt. of limb Patrum</note> 
                  <hi>Biſhop <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher Primat of Armagh,</hi> a very learned man, to avoid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Chriſts</hi> deſcent into hell, according to the Article of the <hi>Creed,</hi> in the plaine ſenſe thereof, doth ſo turn it and winde it, that he makes the ſenſe of the words, <hi>He deſcended into hell</hi> to be, <hi>He aſcended into heaven:</hi> to ſuch pittifull refuges doth the weakneſſe of a bad cauſe drive them. And thus they that have the moſt learning amongſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by unhappy accident bred up in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous <hi>Religion,</hi> and thereby preſuming it to be true, do bend all the endeavours of their learning to the maintenance of their errors, and the obſcuring of the truth; which learning, if it were directed to the right end, might by juſt title claime a place in the firſt file of deſert: even like a torch which turned downward, is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:105178:205"/> with that wax, which held upward would make it bright and glorious. But though their learning were a hundred times doubled, yet as <hi>Aarons</hi> ſerpent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>Magicians</hi> ſerpents, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.12. ſo the wiſedome of God, which is in his Church, will confound the ſenſuall wiſdome of all her oppoſers; ſeeing <hi>there is no wiſdome, nor prudence, nor councell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, Prov.</hi> 21.30.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. I further obſerved that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for themſelves were very fallacious; moſt frequently in that which the <hi>Logicians</hi> call FALLACIA CONSEqUENCIA, which is when the conſequence is not juſtly inferred; for example, they argue thus; the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is called a figure of <hi>Chriſts</hi> body, therefore it is not his true and reall body; which is a falſe Conſequence, for it may be both; even as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>a figure of the ſubſtance of his father, Heb.</hi> 1.3. and yet is alſo the ſame ſubſtance. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>come unto me,</hi> therefore we may go to no body elſe, which is falſe; for we may go to him and others alſo. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, that <hi>we are Justified by faith,</hi> therefore ſay they not by works; whereas we are juſtified by both. We muſt confeſſe our ſinnes to God,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:105178:206"/> therefore not to a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> whereas wee muſt do both, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the head of the <hi>Church,</hi> therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> is not; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as both are in ſeverall capacities. The like might be ſaid in many others; by which kind of arguing, unlearned people are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly deluded, &amp; think that while one thing muſt be done, that muſt be done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the veine of that word <hi>(only)</hi> invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Luther</hi> in the matter of juſtification by faith running through the whole body of their <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Moreover I found this contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt the <hi>Patrons</hi> of <hi>Proteſtancy;</hi> that ſome of them reject the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and accuſe them of being infected with the errors which prevailed in their times; and what were their errors? even all that they taught contrary to their <hi>Proteſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;</hi> ſo making themſelves the rule to judge the Fathers by, and not the <hi>Fathers</hi> (which any wiſe man would think more fit) a rule to themſelves; who no doubt knew the <hi>Scriptures</hi> alſo, and what was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable or contrary to them better than they: <hi>Proteſtants</hi> being herein like carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who wear their rule at their backs, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind them &amp; neglecting thoſe that ſhould guide their belief. But other <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:105178:206"/> aſhamed of this inſolency, pretend for the credit of their cauſe, that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> are altogether on their ſide; and then with much labour hunt out ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure paſſages, moſt liable to be wreſted, and triumph therein, as if they had found a demonſtration, which when they are ſifted, either they make nothing for them or elſe quite againſt them: who in this caſe are like to a man ready to be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who to ſave himſelfe will catch hold on a naked ſword, with which he cuts his fingers; So <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſunk into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of their cauſe, think to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that which ſerves but to encreaſe their overthrow.</p>
               <p>They pretend alſo to anſwer many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the <hi>Fathers</hi> alledged by <hi>Catholiques,</hi> and to give their words a Proteſtant mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thereby run the <hi>Fathers</hi> into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradiction of themſelves; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the <hi>Fathers</hi> have but ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique paſſages which ſeem (and but ſeem) to make for them, (as whoever ſpake ſo exactly, nay who can poſſibly ſpeak ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, as that his words may not be made to ſeem different from his meaning?) but they have whole Bookes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Tractates, and a world of diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:105178:207"/> places, of purpoſe, in the maintenance of <hi>Catholique truths.</hi> And though they ſay that the <hi>Fathers</hi> taught <hi>Proteſtant doctrine,</hi> and they give a Proteſtant ſenſe (though very incongruous) to many of the places of the <hi>Fathers</hi> alledged by <hi>Catholiques,</hi> yet they dare not uſe thoſe words and Phraſes of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Maſſe,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> concerning <hi>reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, prayers to Saints</hi> and for the <hi>dead, merits, ſatisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> with the like, in their prayers, Sermons, and books which if they ſpeak Proteſtant Doctrine, in the true ſenſe of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> (as they ſay they do) why do they not with the ſenſe, make uſe of the words and ſpeeches alſo? I can conceive no other reaſon, but for fear the peoples underſtandings (not ſo fraught with prejudice, nor acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their uncouth evaſions,) ſhould carry them to the direct meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo either in thoſe things become Popiſh themſelves, or accuſe their teachers of <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Another fraud I have obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Canonical Proteſtants,</hi> which is, that when they diſpute againſt <hi>Catholikes,</hi> they have recourſe to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and wil be tried by that only; but when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:105178:207"/> againſt the <hi>Puritanes</hi> and other <hi>Sects</hi> amongſt them, who deal with them at their own weapon of <hi>Scripture</hi> only, then they have recourſe to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and uſe the ſame arguments againſt Sectaries, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi> do againſt them; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the points of baptizing of Infants, againſt the <hi>Anabaptists;</hi> and the keeping of the firſt day of the week holy, againſt the <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> who would have Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; for either of which there is not any command in <hi>Scripture.</hi> And ſhall <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſerve them in thoſe caſes, and not in others? Or ſhall <hi>Scripture</hi> with them prove all other points, and not thoſe? And this ſhift is ſuch a one, as S. <hi>Auguſtine (in Pſal.</hi> 80.) witneſſes to be common to <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Heretiques.</hi> For as <hi>Foxes</hi> have two holes to ſave themſelves by, one, when they are driven from the other; ſo <hi>Heretiques</hi> (whom the Scripture figures out by <hi>Foxes,</hi> when the Spouſe ſaith, <hi>Let us take the young Foxes that deſtroy the vines, Cant.</hi> 2.15.) have a double paſſage to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by; the one, when they are aſſaulted by the other; ſo that he that will catch them, muſt ſet his nets before both iſſues, and beſiege both paſſages, as the excellent
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:105178:208"/> 
                  <hi>Catholique Writers</hi> have done, and have left them neither <hi>Tradition</hi> nor <hi>Scripture</hi> wherby to eſcape.</p>
               <p>For although the <hi>Scripture</hi> do not teach all in direct and particular terms that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> do, yet it teaches nothing that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> do, in the things they differ from <hi>Catholiques.</hi> And <hi>in generall</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> teaches all that <hi>Catholiques</hi> do, by refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us to <hi>Tradition.</hi> And this is ſufficient; for it is not required, that all that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or do, be expreſly ſet downe in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> it is enough, that there be no <hi>Scripture</hi> againſt it, for what is not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is lawfull; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion, Rom.</hi> 4.15. If then there be no law of <hi>Scripture</hi> againſt it, it is lawfull; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be warranted by the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to which the <hi>Scripture</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres us, and is to us more evident to come from God, than the <hi>Scripture</hi> is, which we do not know to do ſo, but by the <hi>Churches teſtimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that I found the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were like to the <hi>Giant Procuſtus,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who having a great iron bed fit for himſelf, all ſtrangers that he took he layed therein, and if
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:105178:208"/> they were too long for the bed, he cut off ſo much of their leggs, if too ſhort, he ſtretched them out till they came even; So the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> having built a <hi>Religion</hi> after the modell of their owne fancy, doe examine <hi>Scriptures, Councells, Fathers,</hi> and all authority by it, whereof ſome they cut off, as being too long, in affirming more than they do; and others being too ſhort for their purpoſe, they miſerably ſerue, tenter, and rack, till they come to the length they deſire. And had I the wicked ambition by impiety to make my ſelfe famous, I believe, I could conjure up new opinions, which (laying aſide the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Church</hi>) I could varniſh with as much reaſon and <hi>Scripture,</hi> as any they profeſſe; Whoſe attempts have had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe then <hi>Achelous</hi> had in fighting with <hi>Hercules,</hi> who took upon him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhapes, hopeing in one or other to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him; but was by <hi>Hercules</hi> beaten through all his ſhapes, and forced at laſt to take his owne proper ſhape, and yeeld: So Proteſtants fighting againſt <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi> are by them beaten through all their changes, and formes, and ſhifts through which they wander, and are forced at laſt to take the true forme
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:105178:209"/> of <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> which is obſtinatly to deny the plaine and manifeſt truth; But I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray that it would pleaſe God to bring them to the true form, which they ought to have, which is of <hi>Roman Catholique;</hi> untill which they will (like the blinded <hi>Sodomites</hi>) perpetually roule, wander and grope in the darkneſſe of uncertainty, and inſtability, till eternall darkneſſe ſeize upon them. For by embarquing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch an enterprize as is the board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ship of <hi>Peter,</hi> they are like to arrive at no other port, but ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Moreover I found this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to be moſt uneaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and full of pride, in that they being but few in number, eſpecially in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, yea but one, one infinitely auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, <hi>Luther,</hi> once a child of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> ſhould preſume to correct or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the whole Chriſtian world; a thing which no man would admit in the private regiment of his own family, that a ſonne or ſervant ſhould preſume to find fault with, and change the cuſtoms of the houſe againſt the conſent of the Father, Maſter, and all the reſt, and aſſume to himſelfe alone to be judge of the cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:105178:209"/>
               <p>One earneſtly deſiring <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a popular State in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> that the baſeſt might have as great authority as the higheſt, anſwered, <hi>Begin to doe ſo firſt in thine owne houſe;</hi> which he refuſed, and thereby ſaw the injuſtice of his own demand: So theſe men that will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit within themſelves, either in matters Eccleſiaſticall or civill, that they whoſe duty it is to obey, ſhould command, they whoſe duty it is to learne, ſhould teach, withwhat face can they defend the practiſe thereof in the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the houſe of God; of which our predeceſſors were guilty in the firſt attempt, and this preſent generation in the continuance of their Rebellion? Nor let them think that their having of the <hi>Bible</hi> in the <hi>Mother-tongue</hi> will ſave them, as if it were like the <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> a thing dropt down from heaven, no man knowes how, with this condition annexed, that while they kept it in their city they ſhould never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; while in the mean time they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pollute it with two things, their interpretation and their converſation; whereas the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath not only the word, but the meaning of God alſo, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>we have the ſenſe of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:105178:210"/> Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. both proved by never-erring authority.</p>
               <p>And laſtly weighing all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> arguments with all impartiality, or if there were any inclination of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, it was to their ſide, with whoſe doctrines I had been from my childhood ſeaſoned, and had been a teacher of others for the ſpace of neere twenty yeares, and to whom to receive contrary impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I knew muſt prove extreamly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall; who therefore addreſt my ſelfe to this enquiry, with the diſpoſition of a jealous husband, ſeeking that which I was moſt loath to find; yet all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I found that all their pleas and pretences, and their anſwers to <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> were weake, ſleight, falſe or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; and (like to a certain fiſh called <hi>Sleve,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which hath a body like a ſword, but wants a heart,) they had (at leaſt in the opinion of ſome) a ſhew of ſtrength and ſharpneſſe, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly had no power, Spirit, or vigour. And that all their ſpecious ſhewes of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Reformation, and Evangelicall truth, were but like a ſhallow brook or plaſh of water, wherein we may diſcern the Sun, or moone and ſtars, with the whole face of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:105178:210"/> heaven, as if it were as deep as heaven is high, when if we but ſound it with our little finger, we pierce it through even to the earth: So their pretences of the pure Word of God, heavenly truth, and nothing but the truth, (as if like <hi>Promethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> they had fetch'd it themſelves from heaven) being fathomed, I found no dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than the ſhallow conceits of private heads; And that like <hi>Micol</hi> they had ſent away <hi>David,</hi> and laid an Image in his place, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. they had renounced the true and living Word of God, which is the true ſenſe thereof, and laid an image of their owne fancy, dreſt in the ſame let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the room thereof; and ſo were (though not of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> which they ought, yet) worſhippers of their owne imaginations, which they ought not, as being a high <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. Theſe, theſe are the motives, which have inclined me to believe that the <hi>Church of England</hi> and all other <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches,</hi> are guilty both of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Schiſme; two ſinnes of higheſt nature, the one againſt God, the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our neighbour, the one againſt faith, the other againſt charity, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying their beliefe to doctrines revealed
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:105178:211"/> by God the ſupreme Author, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> the ſupreme witneſſe of divine truth; and by rending the ſeamleſſe coat of <hi>Christ,</hi> ſeparating from the Communion of his <hi>Church,</hi> and that (as ſome of their moſt learned ſay,) for things not fundamentall; and what can be more imprudent, than for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundamentall error to commit a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſinne? And ſuch it is to ſeparate from the <hi>true Church,</hi> as the learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them confeſſe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be.</p>
               <p>And as the pretended errors for which they did ſeparate, (they confeſſe) were not fundamentall, ſo for ought they know (for they confeſſe that the judgement of their <hi>Church</hi> may erre) they were no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at all; and ſo again, for ought they know, they have not reformed, but defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves; and are gone out of Gods bleſſing (as we ſay) into the warm Sun. What madeſſe it is to make, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a ſeparation from a true <hi>Church,</hi> ſo acknowledged by all <hi>Christians,</hi> upon pretences not accounted true by any but themſelves, and nor certainly known to be true, ſo much as by themſelves. And as S. <hi>Auguſtine (de unit. Eccleſ. c.</hi> 3.) argues
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105178:211"/> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> If both ſides were true they had no cauſe to ſeparate, and to fly from thoſe whom they had in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If both falſe, there was no cauſe of ſeparation, that they ſhould fly from thoſe who were no more faulty than themſelves. If our doctrines are true and theirs falſe, there was no cauſe of their ſeparation, becauſe they ought rather to have amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves and continued in unity: and if ours are falſe and theirs true, there was no cauſe of their ſeparation, becauſe they ought not to have forſaken the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent world, to whom either they would not, or they could not demonſtrate their truth. Nor can it excuſe them to ſay, that ſuch or ſuch things are againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for as much as they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their conſciences by the Word of God in the mouth of the <hi>Church,</hi> not of themſelves, (otherwiſe contentious and ſelf-will'd Spirits will never want this plea, to ſeparate from the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo to ſerve God with their Will-worſhip,) and not to demand of the <hi>Church,</hi> that ſhe make her conſcience ſtoope to a compliance with theirs, which is inſolent and unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that he that doth any thing
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:105178:212"/> againſt his conſcience ſins, ſo alſo if he do not that which he is commanded, he ſins; therefore to reconcile this conflict of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, men may and muſt (though it go againſt the grain of their private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſubmit themſelves by an implicite faith to the <hi>Church,</hi> by believing her to be wiſer than themſelves, and ſo belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what ſhe ſaith to be true. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this conſcience would be a plea for all diſobedience and impiety; when wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men might ſay, that they could not be perſwaded in their conſcience, that the things they were commanded to believe or do, were good, but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were ſo, and therefore they would do them. Thus erroneous men may think it lawfull to commit murder or adultery, as all <hi>Rebells</hi> do the one, and <hi>Familists</hi> and <hi>Adamites</hi> the other. And we ſee that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (who make <hi>conſcience</hi> their Plea againſt the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and a ground of Separation) will not admit this from others that are under their command.</p>
               <p>The legall <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would not permit any man, under pretence of conſcience, to refuſe the Oath of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> but thought all men
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105178:212"/> bound to ſubmit their beliefes therein to them. And now the <hi>Reformers</hi> of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, who heretofore complained of it as an <hi>Egyptian burden,</hi> to have any thing impoſed on them againſt their conſcience, make no ſcruple to impoſe upon other mens conſciences, in their oaths, <hi>Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> of conſpiracy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt their lawfull Prince, and of believing a <hi>Religion</hi> not only now in Being, but whatſoever hereafter ſhall be by them contrived; nor will they ſuffer any mans tenderneſſe of conſcience, to be a ground for the ſeparation of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. So that the ſeparation of all <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of conſcience, as it hath no ground of truth, ſo hath it not either of prudence or juſtice.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. And if the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Chilling worthians,</hi> will be (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) the ſervants of reaſon, and follow her whither ſhe ſhall guide them, I cannot ſee how they can avoid coming to the <hi>Catholique Roman Church.</hi> For ſeeing that (according to them) there is no infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble certainty of the truth of any point of Faith, (for if there be ſo, it is in their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls; yet ſeeing they have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:105178:213"/> knowledge what thoſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls are, they muſt needs ſlide back againe to their former univerſall uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty:) all the aſſurance they have in matter of religion, can be but probable: Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the great Maſter of reaſon, gives this rule of probability; <hi>That</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is probable, which ſeems ſo to all, or to the most, or to the most wiſe; and amongſt them, to all, or to the moſt, or to the moſt famous and eminent;</hi> which rule is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to reaſon, as I think no reaſonable creature will deny it. Nor can any <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> (except pride and ignorance ſhut the doore of his confeſſion) deny that this rule of probability, amongſt all ſorts of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is applyable only to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholique Church;</hi> there having been infinitely more, and more wiſe and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people of her Communion, than of any other; yea many times there have been, when ſhee hath enfolded all <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in her armes, and not one to be found out of her Communion, her doctrines then (in reaſon) are to be received as moſt probable.</p>
               <p>And (as ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay) naturall bodies doe neglect the lawes and rules of of their particular motions, to ſerve and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105178:213"/> follow the lawes of univerſall nature; of which one is, That there muſt be no <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or place utterly empty; which law to obſerve, we ſee that heavie bodies will riſe upward, which otherwiſe would fall downward: So the particular rules of reaſon, in particular men, (if they will ſhew themſelves the dutifull children of reaſon) muſt give place to this generall and univerſall rule of reaſon implanted in mankind; and when they are inclined one way to an opinion, by their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and domeſtique reaſon, they muſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend that inclination, and conquer the provocations thereof, and readily yeeld unto the fundamentall and univerſall law of reaſon; which is, that in matters of whoſe truth there is no infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is moſt likely to be true, and hath the moſt reaſon on its ſide, wherein the moſt, and the moſt reaſonable of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures doe agree Which if they doe, they ſhall not run upon the rock of believing contradictions, (as ſome of them imagine;) but ſhall find themſelves obliged by the train of their owne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to become <hi>Roman Catholiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations, together with the great aſſiſtance of Gods grace, have
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:105178:214"/> cauſed me to forſake the Communion of all <hi>Protestant Churches,</hi> who, like thoſe mentioned in S. <hi>John, ſay they are Jewes,</hi> the true Church, <hi>and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan, Revel.</hi> 2.9.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. NOw for a Concluſion, let me invite the Reader to ſtand (as it were) upon mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and take a view of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the <hi>Roman Catholique Church,</hi> on the one ſide, and the wilderneſſe of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches</hi> on the other.</p>
               <p>Here amongſt <hi>Catholiques,</hi> you ſhall ſee a <hi>Church</hi> like the cloud that appeared to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> as big as a mans hand, which by and by ſpread over the face of the earth; a <hi>Church</hi> which hath incircled in her armes (at leaſt in their predeceſſors) all that ever wore the name of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> which hath ſtretched her dominions, as far as the Sun his beames, and whereſoever he hath beſtowed his corporall, ſhe hath beſtowed her ſpirituall light.</p>
               <p>There amongſt <hi>Protestants,</hi> you ſhall ſee <hi>Churches</hi> that have got poſſeſſion only
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:105178:216"/> of the moſt obſcure places, and that by patches, like a poor mans land; and thoſe too uſurped by fraud, and violence from the juſt owners thereof; not purchaſed, but ſtolne.</p>
               <p>Here you ſhall ſee a <hi>Church</hi> that hath continued without interruption ſince the firſt planting thereof; that hath kept per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Term without <hi>Vacation;</hi> that in all the rough tempeſts of this worlds per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, hath ſtill rid out the ſtorme: and though by the tyranny of <hi>heathen</hi> and <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques</hi> millions of her children did fall, it was but like the morning deaw, watering thereby the ſeeds of grace, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had ſowne; and when they calmly bled, it was but oyle to the <hi>Apoſtles lamps,</hi> whoſe bright flames may yet ſerve to light poſterity to heaven. And as the enemies of the city of <hi>Rome</hi> were wont to weep to ſee it on fire, becauſe it would afterwards be fairer built; ſo the devill (though he cauſed it, yet) did mourne to ſee the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> on fire in her <hi>Martyrs,</hi> which was ever repaired by a greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of converts, who conſtantly kept the faith, till they loſt themſelves in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, like <hi>Naboth</hi> who kept his poſſeſſion, with the loſſe of his blood.</p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:105178:217"/>
               <p>There you ſhall ſee <hi>Churches</hi> like <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> riſing and ſetting by turnes, ſometimes alive, ſometimes dead; with ſuch huge great gaps between the times of their ſubſiſting, that for any ſuccour they could have from them, millions of ſoules might in the interim have dropt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell. And as the <hi>Moabites</hi> when they ſaw the waters look ruddy, thought they had been mingled with blood, when it was but the reflexion of the morning ſun beames on them; ſo when they ſuffered any thing, they called it perſecution for their obedience to God, when it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but the effect of juſtice on them, for their <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt Gods deputies Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and civill, the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>Prince:</hi> and inſtead of giving them increaſe, as perſecution hath alwaies done to the <hi>Church,</hi> it did (with the aid of their inward diſcords) utterly extingniſh them. Who have had none, but have made many <hi>Martyrs;</hi> reviving even in theſe later &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times, the antient copies of cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Catholikes;</hi> blindly believing that by killing Gods ſervants, they do God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Whoſe meek ſpirits have paid as large a tribute of patience unto heaven and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance to the world, as any that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:105178:217"/> them; and have proved in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the truth of the <hi>Spouſes</hi> ſaying in the <hi>Canticles;</hi> ch. 5. v. 10. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy,</hi> being blanch'd with the whiteneſſe of innocence, &amp; guled with the blood of martyrdom, the fury of whoſe malice and perſecution hath purſued many even through the gates of death, adding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation to their cruelty, by diſturbing the dead bodies, and ſilent urnes of <hi>Saints</hi> departed. A poor revenge and fooliſh, which doth more expreſſe their hatred, than ſatisfie it; and ſhewes that their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice doth more afflict their owne minds before it is executed, than it can doe their enemies bodies in the execution: So eager, ſo importunate is ſinne, ever to its owne ſhame.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Here you ſhall ſee a <hi>Church</hi> that hath alwaies been in view; whom neither fear nor coyneſſe hath made to hide her head, and whoſe admired beauty hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited all men to her chaſt embraces, and like <hi>Meduſaes</hi> head hath turned them to ſtones of this living building, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of her ſurpaſſing beauty.</p>
               <p>There you ſhall ſee <hi>Churches,</hi> ſuch (which is very ſtrange) as were never ſeen, or very ſeldome; keeping ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:105178:218"/> and retired ſtate, that men (like <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> who went about <hi>Athens</hi> with a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and a lanterne at noone day, to ſeek an honeſt man) muſt doe ſo about the world to find them out, and in the mean time periſh for want of ſpirituall aid: who never had any beauty, riches, or rarity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, but only <hi>Giges</hi> his ring, whereby they did for the moſt part walk inviſible. The <hi>Engliſh Proverb</hi> ſaith, that <hi>where God hath his Church, the devill hath his Chappell;</hi> and ſo he hath alwaies had in <hi>Heretiques,</hi> who in regard of place have been mingled with <hi>Catholiques;</hi> but that the devill ſhould have all the <hi>Church,</hi> and God not ſo much as the <hi>Chappell,</hi> (as they pretend) is moſt incredible.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Here you ſhall ſee a <hi>Church</hi> like the city <hi>of Jeruſalem,</hi> that is at unity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelfe; and like the wals of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> ſo cloſely united, that they ſeem to be all but one entire ſtone. And as God ſpake of old, <hi>By the mouth of his Prophets, Luc.</hi> 1.70. intimating, that though they were many <hi>Prophets,</hi> yet they had all but one mouth, in regard of the unity and agreement of their ſayings; ſo ſpeakes he now by the mouth of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>Catholique Church:</hi> A body having <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:105178:218"/> head, <hi>from whom</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>the whole body being fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt ſupplies, according to the effectuall working in the meaſure of every part, makes encreaſe of the body to the edifying of it ſelfe in love;</hi> Whoſe powerfull union, like the <hi>Bundle of Arrowes</hi> preſented by the <hi>Emperour Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> to his ſonnes, as the <hi>Embleme</hi> of united ſtrength, cannot be broken by the aſſault of any force; which like the <hi>floating Ilands,</hi> or the ſtone <hi>Tyrrhenus,</hi> being unbroken, floats ſtill aloft, and keepes her head above the main; when others like clods of earth rent from the <hi>Jland,</hi> or broken in pieces of that ſtone, ſink to the bottom and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
               <p>There you ſhall ſee <hi>Churches</hi> ſtand like the ſtones in ſome high waies to meaſure their length, a mile aſunder from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And as the <hi>Cameleon</hi> changes it ſelf into all colours except white; So they wander through all the forms of opinions that fancy can imagine, ſaving only truth; Which need no externall diſaſters to try their ſtrength, no forraine enemies to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their deſtruction; For like the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi> teeth ſown by <hi>Cadmus,</hi> or the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally-hating brethren <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:105178:219"/> they with mutuall cruelties deſtroy each other. Here a <hi>Church</hi> that for the admirable effects of her unity, deſerves the name of that pretious ſtone, which for the rarity thereof is called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> There ſuch, as for the variety and deformity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are poſſeſſed, may be termed <hi>Legion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Here you ſhall ſee a <hi>Church</hi> that religiouſly triumphs over all <hi>Chriſtian Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes</hi> of the world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them the <hi>Trophees</hi> of her ſpirituall victories and converſions; whoſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full influence hath caſt a charme upon the fierce and lionly natures of barbarous Princes; and hath not only made the <hi>Lion</hi> and the <hi>lamb</hi> to live together, (as was foretold by the <hi>Prophet</hi>) but hath turned the Lions into Lambs. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great being asked if hee would run at the <hi>Olympick games,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I could be content, ſo I might run with Kings;</hi> Here then may be exerciſed a vertuous ambition, and truly worthy of the majeſty of the <hi>moſt excellent King of England,</hi> who if he will honour the <hi>Church</hi> and himſelfe to run this way, ſhall run with almoſt all <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian world,</hi> both his owne and other <hi>Kings</hi> predeceſſors, and that at the true

                  <hi>Olympick exerciſes,</hi> the exerciſes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>There you ſhall ſee <hi>Churches</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the power to invite a King or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Communion, but ſuch as were born to it; or at firſt compel'd to it, by the violence of ſome prevailing faction; or moved to it, by oblique and ſelf-reflecting ends. Barren and in jurious <hi>Churches,</hi> that live not by their own labour, and the gaines they make thereof, but boaſt only of that which they have raviſhed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and convert not from Heatheniſm, but neerer to it.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Here you ſhall ſee a <hi>Church</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wonders far above the power of all created Beings; commanding (by the rich dowry of her husband and <hi>Saviour</hi>) heaven, earth and hell, and all the frame of the creation; making them bow their fixt and ſtubborn natures, and meekly yeeld to the dreadfull command of man, propt by omnipotent Divinity. In which the miracle of miracles, <hi>Tranſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is moſt frequently wrought, even millions of times a day, and ſufficiently proved to be ſo, by the frequent effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of blood that it hath made (like mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered bodies many times bleeding afreſh
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:105178:220"/> in the preſence of the murderers) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the incredulity of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques;</hi> which if it do not ſo, to thoſe that do not ſee it (having credible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof) as well as to thoſe that ſee it, ſhall one day, with the reſt of his moſt precious ſoul-healing balm, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their unhappy hands, when he ſhall come incircled with flames, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with dreadfull thunder, to throw down vengeance on the impious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers; who ſhall remedileſly feel that which heretofore they would not believe, that <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be damned, Mark.</hi> 16.16.</p>
               <p>There you ſhall ſee <hi>Churches</hi> that do wonders indeed, but they are wondrous evills; the fowleſt in all the ſtock and brood of villany; too many to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not to be forgiven; for that therefore I will alwaies pray. <hi>Churches</hi> that are ſo poor in proof of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they neither come neere the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> nor yet do ſo much as the accurſed <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> for he ſhall do ſome wonders, but they do none: Or at leaſt it is but one only <hi>Miracle</hi> that they do, and that is, that being (as they ſay) the true pure <hi>Church of God,</hi> they do no

                  <hi>Miracle.</hi> And one <hi>Miracle</hi> I beſeech God to do amongſt them, (and eſpecially in the once-every-way happy, and the now-every-way miſerable <hi>Kingdome of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>) that is, once more to convert them to his true faith, and <hi>Catholique Roman Church,</hi> where it is only to be had; that they may ſee and ſubmit, before it be too late, to him whom they have pierced; and may (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> admoniſheth the <hi>Church of Epheſus) remember from whence they are faln, repent and do their firſt works, (Rev.</hi> 2.5.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all hope, to ſee the Kingdome flouriſh, be withered; and that by their falling from bad to worſe; there remaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a fearfull expectation of ſeeing it over-run, and poſſeſſed by ſome barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation, as the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> are by the <hi>Turks,</hi> (for their Hereſies moſt likely, and Schiſm from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>) or elſe, that they will become ſuch themſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Here you may ſee a Church that is the worlds SANCTUM SANCTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUM, <hi>moſt holy place,</hi> guilded with the lives of innumerable (both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) perſons of matchleſſe ſanctity, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the vailes of their coarſe cloth, and neglected fleſh; yea in the

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:105178:221"/> weight is laid, the firmer and ſtronger they are. And are (many of them) ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſied with heavenly raptures, that their unbodied ſoules leave them forgetfull of all things that may tend to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall preſervation. Having ſuch ſtrong impreſſions of the preſence of God, that whereſoever they are, or whatſoever do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſo behave themſelves, as if with S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> they heard the ſound of the <hi>Archangells</hi> trump ſummoning them to judgment: Which high degrees of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they underprop with the baſis of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; and (like the weightieſt eares of corn) bow down their heads the loweſt to the earth; and ſtand like figures in <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metique,</hi> where the laſt in place is greateſt in account.

               </p>
               <p>There you ſhall ſee Churches calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely for the meridian of fleſh and blood; whoſe Apocryphall Prieſthood cannot beget Canonicall, much leſſe ſuper-canonicall vertues; whoſe Prieſts (like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks which we ſee carved on the ſides of ſumptuous buildings, ſeem with their

And what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines of the perfume of goodneſſe yet amongſt the people, (bating the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of nature) is but the reliques of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſcent, perhaps not yet utterly faded.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Laſtly look upon the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church,</hi> and you ſhall ſee a thing ſo complete and perfect in all her dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as if it had been (as indeed it was) moulded on a heavenly frame, many members built up into one body, and that body united under one head, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning moſt ſweet and admirable corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, having in it ſelfe all fit means for the ſpirituall conſervation both of the <hi>individuum,</hi> and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> of the particular body, and of the kind: For birth here is <hi>Baptiſme; Confirmation</hi> for ſtrength and advancement in the ſtate of grace: The <hi>ſacred Euchariſt</hi> for our daily ſtock of ſpirituall improvement and encreaſe.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105178:222"/> and wounds, which we receive in our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian warfare,</hi> here are Phyſitians with the <hi>balme of Gilead,</hi> the good <hi>Samaritanes</hi> with wine and oyle to powre into our wounds, the holy <hi>Priests</hi> after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> with the <hi>Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> to cure all our maladies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts for theſe cures contriv'd with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous art; for as bodily evills are cured ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with things of the ſame quality or the contrary, ſo here. For wounds given by the world, here is a cure by giving the world away in almes. For wounds received from the fleſh, a cure by mortifying the fleſh with faſting and other auſterities. A cure for the fiery darts of the devill, by the darts of prayers ſhot up to heaven. And when we depart this life (for this warfare muſt not alwaies laſt) here is precious oile to embalme our ſoules with grace; which like the oyle to the antient <hi>Roman wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> makes us nimble &amp; agile in our lateſt wraſtlings with the devill, that we may ſlip out of his hands, and be preſented, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God. And that this holy <hi>Church</hi> may continue in ſucceſſion, untill her royall <hi>Bridegroom</hi> call her up to his own throne, here is <hi>Holy Sacramentall Matrimony,</hi> both to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:105178:223"/> that union, and by grace to encreaſe it. And that this multitude may not beget confuſion, here are <hi>holy Orders,</hi> by vertue whereof, they that are ordained do go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern this ſociety, as ſpirituall <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and conduct it, as ſpirituall <hi>Captaines,</hi> through the wilderneſſe of this world, to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which is above. Here is the true <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints</hi> both of thoſe in heaven, in earth, and under the earth, by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipations of each others Prayers, Merits, and Satisfactions. Here is, as in all well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Common-Wealths, Juſtice both commutative, and diſtributive: Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative betwixt God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ranſome for us, and purchaſed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for us, and we take poſſeſſion upon the conditions required: diſtributive in rendring rewards and puniſhments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the geometricall proportion of mens merits or offences.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. Here are the <hi>Arcana imperii,</hi> high and myſterious things, ſuch as are worthy the wiſedome and contrivance of God. Things to be believed, by the world, thought incredible; things done by God, and to be done by us, by the world thought impoſſible, things to be ſuffered,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:105178:223"/> by the world thought intolerable: and they are believed, done, and ſuffered, which could not be effected, but by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er omnipotent. And becauſe they are ſo difficult, none but God could ſubdue mortalls to the belief and practiſe of them; and therefore, even becauſe they are ſuch, they prove him only to be their author. For who can imagine that <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> a thing ſo much againſt the bias of fleſh and bloud, or the belief of <hi>Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> a thing ſo far above the reach of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, could have got ſuch poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſoules of Chriſtian mankind, and that without any externall violence, had not the finger of God writ it on mens hearts. In doctrines of this <hi>Church,</hi> that will admit the uſe of reaſon for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionableneſſe, no things ſeem more reaſonable; and where they are above reaſon nothing can be more ſublime, and befitting God the Author of this <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the husband of this <hi>Church.</hi> God, who is the God of reaſon, (of which that ſmall portion which man is Maſter of, which yet ennobles him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all bodily creatures, is but a ray from the ſplendor of his all-ſeeing ſun-light, a ſpark from his celeſtiall fire) <hi>worketh all
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:105178:224"/> things according to the counſell of his will, Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. which counſell implies pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and reaſon in his actions; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the type of that eternall law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he workes himſelfe, and commands all his creatures to work. And by this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter the doctrines and the diſcipline of the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> proclaim him for their Author; and are not therefore to be diſgraced (as they are by <hi>Protestants</hi>) by the ill-ſenſed name of policy; giving to the vertue of higheſt wiſedome, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription of deceitfull cunning. And the knowledge of thoſe things, which in the government of this nobleſt <hi>Kingdome of Christ</hi> ſurmount the reach of preſent reaſon, are reſerv'd for a reward of our humble belief, in the life to come; when our faith ſhall be happily turned into ſight; and we ſhall cleerly ſee, and be fully and eternally ſatisfied, with the reaſon of al thoſe things, which now our ſhort under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings have not line enough to fathom. <hi>Excellent things are ſpoken of thee thou city of God, Pſal.</hi> 86.3. And as it is written of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that his body was of ſuch an excellent compoſition, that it ſent forth ſweet vapours that perfumed all his clothes; and our <hi>Saviour</hi> we know
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:105178:224"/> had ſuch abundant vertue flowing from him, that it cured ſuch as touched him; ſuch is the body of the <hi>Church,</hi> of ſo rare, ſo holy, and ſo rationall a compoſure, that vertue goes out of her, and ſanctifies; and wiſedome, and makes reaſonable all her garments, all her utenſils, and whatſoever appertaines to her, <hi>the ſmell of thy garment is like the ſmell of Frankincenſe, Cant.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>And if any third party that were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Roman,</hi> nor of any <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> ſhould obſerve the admirable frame of this <hi>Church,</hi> both in regard of the doctrine &amp; diſcipline, he would ſurely ſay, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the Corinthians, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25.) <hi>God is truly in you;</hi> and with the <hi>Patriarch</hi> Jacob, <hi>How dreadfull is this place? this is no other than the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heaven; Gen.</hi> 28.17. and as in the <hi>Canticles</hi> 6.10. this is ſhe <hi>that goeth forth like the ſpringing morn, faire as the moon, choice as the ſun, terrible as an army in battel aray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But looking on the <hi>Churches of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> or any ſort of <hi>Heretiques,</hi> he ſhould ſee a body without a head; or (which is as monſtrous) an <hi>hydra,</hi> a beaſt with many heads, and that poſſibly may have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, if Kingdomes ſhould be leſſened
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:105178:225"/> and encreaſed: having a law without a Judge; but every one that is a party, clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that power, in his owne cauſe. Where they have no aſſurance that their law is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, but by the teſtimony of thoſe they account their adverſaries, and the greateſt lyars and ſeducers of the world. Who have amongſt them no faith but opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no charity, but humanity, no hope fitly tempered with fear, but bold preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pretended aſſurance; for which, they that are the moſt confident, have the leaſt cauſe of any men in the world. Where there is no beauty, comelineſſe, or order worthy the Bride of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not yet of the deſign or owning of any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or wiſe and prudent man. But as ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> hold that the world was made by the accidentall concourſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes; So they ſeem to be made by chance, and by chance to come together, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united by any internall form, but only in a politicall oppoſition of her, who is their Mother and Miſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Senate of Rome</hi> having choſen three men to go on an Embaſſie, whereof the one had his head full of cuts and gaſhes, the other was a fool, and the third had the Gout; <hi>Cato</hi> laughing ſaid, that the <hi>Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Holding ſuch monſtrous and abſurd opinions, that they make up a bundle of Heatheniſme, Turciſme, Hereſie, and contradictions to common-ſenſe. Can then any indifferent and prudent man, who knowes that God made the world with wiſdome, in number, weight and meaſure, can he think that they are the <hi>Church</hi> of God, the deare <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> for whoſe ſake he deſcended from his heavenly Throne, and took and loſt humane life? Or <hi>will he not rather ſay, that they are mad?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.
